# Step 1. **Initial Request Analysis**:
- **Objective**: Analyze and extract relevant types of the user's request.
- **Method**:
    - Analyze and extract relevant types of the user's request. Use the following types as reference:
        - Fact Retrieval: Involves seeking specific information or data without requiring analysis or action. These requests seek insights or information, such as definitions, configurations, development and deployment processes, best practices, guidelines, experiences, or historical knowledge of MySQL databases. These information can be retrieved from MySQL documentation. 
        - Root cause analysis: Requests aiming to identify the primary cause of issues or problems within the MySQL environment.
        - Performing O&M actions: Involves executing specific operational and maintenance tasks within the MySQL environment. 
- **Output**:
    - Type of request: Performing O&M actions.
    - Reasoning: The user is asking for optimization of the ACID configuration to improve performance after migrating a MySQL database to NVM storage hardware.

# Step 2. **O&M Topic Extraction**:
- **Objective**: For each type of request listed by Step 1, identify and extract relevant O&M topics from the user request.
- **Method**:
    - For each type of request listed by Step 1, review the user's request for keywords or phrases that align with the predefined O&M topics.
    - Topics for reference: 
        - Performance Tuning
        - Backup and Recovery
        - Security Auditing
        - Scaling Operations
        - Database Migration
        - Data Modeling and Design
        - Monitoring and Alerting
        - Troubleshooting
- **Output**:
    - Extracted O&M topics in order of relevance:
        - Performance Tuning: The request specifically asks for optimization of the ACID configuration for improved performance.
        - Database Migration: The task involves changes made due to the recent migration to NVM storage hardware.
    - Explanation:
        - Performance Tuning: The user's request directly mentions the need to optimize the current configuration, implying the need for performance tuning.
        - Database Migration: Since the optimization is required after a migration to a new storage environment, it relates to tasks following a migration process.

# Step 3. **Generate User's Request Analysis YAML Results**:

```
Request Analysis:
- Type: Performing O&M actions
    Rationale: The user has requested an optimization of the ACID configuration of a MySQL database after a hardware migration, which involves execution of specific tasks to improve performance.
    Topics:
    - Topic: Performance Tuning
        Explanation: Optimizing the ACID configuration for better performance involves evaluating and adjusting system settings, which is a key aspect of performance tuning.
    - Topic: Database Migration
        Explanation: The request is related to the aftermath of a database migration, where adjusting configurations according to the new environment is necessary for optimal performance.
```

# Step 4. **Recourse to the Expert Group**

### User's request
I have migrated the MySQL database instance "DB_1" to NVM storage hardware with NovaFS, please optimise the current ACID configuration of "DB_1" in the new storage environment to improve performance.
