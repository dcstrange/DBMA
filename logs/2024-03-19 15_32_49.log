When optimizing MySQL performance with newly installed NVM (Non-Volatile Memory) storage using a file system like NovaFS, several best practices and guidelines should be considered. These optimizations can enhance the efficiency of MySQL operations and leverage the high-performance characteristics of NVM storage:

1. **Understand the Characteristics of NVM Storage**: NVM storage, such as NVMe SSDs, offer high throughput, low latency, and good IOPS performance. They are also byte-addressable, which means adjustments might be needed in MySQL configurations to take advantage of these properties.

2. **Align MySQL Configuration with NVM Capabilities**:
   - Ensure `innodb_flush_method` is set appropriately. NVM storage can handle a lot of IOPS, so setting `innodb_flush_method=O_DIRECT_NO_FSYNC` can take advantage of that by reducing IO layers.
   - Adjust the `innodb_io_capacity` and `innodb_io_capacity_max` to match the IOPS capabilities of the NVM storage.
   - For the buffer pool, `innodb_buffer_pool_size` should be configured in relation to the available RAM, ensuring that most data operations are in-memory, while still leaving adequate memory for other server processes.

3. **ACID Considerations**: ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. In conjunction with NVM:
   - Durability (`innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit`): Since NVMe SSDs have excellent write performance, you might be able to afford setting this to 1 for maximum durability without a significant performance penalty. However, using 2 may still be acceptable if slight durability relaxation is needed for more throughput.
   - Atomicity and Isolation (`transaction_isolation`): These shouldn't be affected by the storage hardware; they are more related to application requirements and consistency.

4. **File System Configuration**: Ensure that the NovaFS is properly configured. Take advantage of file system characteristics for concurrent access and data consistency. It should support direct access to NVM for optimal performance.

5. **Maximize Concurrent IO**:
   - Evaluate and adjust `innodb_read_io_threads` and `innodb_write_io_threads` to allow MySQL to perform more IO operations in parallel.
   - Configure `innodb_thread_concurrency` and `innodb_concurrency_tickets` to match the server's capability to handle concurrent operations.

6. **Reduce Durability Settings**:
   - If the risk is acceptable, tune durability settings to boost performance, such as using asynchronous IO or delayed durability features.
   - However, always balance performance enhancement against the risk of data loss.

7. **Use innodb_buffer_pool_instances**: Increasing the count of buffer pool instances can improve concurrency by reducing contention on buffer pool mutexes.

8. **Monitoring and Benchmarking**: Use tools like `mysqltuner` or `performance_schema` to monitor MySQL performance and take baseline measurements before making configuration changes. After changes, monitor for improvements or any unexpected issues.

9. **Regular Testing and Recovery Procedures**: With changes to durability settings, ensure you have a robust backup and recovery strategy, and test recoveries regularly.

10. **Operating System Tuning**: Engage with the operating system team to ensure the OS is optimized for NVM storage (e.g., proper driver support, IO scheduler settings).

Remember, performance tuning is an iterative process. Always test configuration changes in a controlled environment before applying them to production systems, and regularly review performance metrics to identify further optimization opportunities.

The MySQL database experts have provided a comprehensive list of best practices and guidelines to optimize your MySQL configuration to take advantage of your new NVM storage hardware with NovaFS for increased performance acceleration. Here are the recommendations:

1. **Understand NVM Storage Characteristics**: Recognize the high throughput and low latency of NVM storage to enhance MySQL performance.

2. **Align MySQL Configuration**:
   - Use `innodb_flush_method` set to `O_DIRECT_NO_FSYNC` to reduce IO layers.
   - Configure `innodb_io_capacity` to match the IOPS capabilities of the NVM storage.
   - Set `innodb_buffer_pool_size` with respect to available RAM for efficient in-memory data operations.

3. **ACID Considerations**:
   - Durability should be prioritized by setting `innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit` to 1 if performance permits.
   - Atomicity and Isolation are more application-dependent and less affected by storage.

4. **File System Configuration**: Ensure NovaFS is optimized for direct NVM access and concurrency.

5. **Maximize Concurrent IO**:
   - Modify `innodb_read_io_threads` and `innodb_write_io_threads` for more parallel IO operations.
   - Tweak `innodb_thread_concurrency` and `innodb_concurrency_tickets` according to server capabilities.

6. **Reduce Durability Settings**: Adjust durability settings for performance, but maintain a robust backup and recovery strategy.

7. **Buffer Pool Instances**: Increase `innodb_buffer_pool_instances` for better concurrency and reduced contention.

8. **Monitoring and Benchmarking**: Use tools like `mysqltuner` or `performance_schema` to monitor performance, particularly before and after changes.

9. **Regular Testing and Recovery Procedures**: Frequently test backup and recovery strategies, especially after adjusting settings.

10. **Operating System Tuning**: Collaborate with your OS team to ensure system optimization for NVM storage, including considerations for driver support and IO scheduler settings.

It is crucial to test changes in a safe environment and to continuously monitor performance metrics for any further optimization. These steps are designed to utilize the high-performance abilities of your NVM storage in conjunction with MySQL, while ensuring a balance between speed and system reliability.
