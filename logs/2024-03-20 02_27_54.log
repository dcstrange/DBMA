Optimizing MySQL performance on NVM (Non-Volatile Memory) storage using the Nova file system involves several key practices. NovaFS is known to excel in performance due to its design for NVMs offering low latency and high throughput. Here are some best practices you might consider:

1. **Leverage NOVA's File System Characteristics:**
   - NOVA is designed specifically for NVM, so it optimizes data writes in a way that reduces wear and enhances performance.
   - Make sure you have NOVA file system mounted with the correct options that enable its performance features.

2. **Align MySQL Configuration with NOVA:**
   - Configure MySQL's `innodb_flush_method` to `O_DIRECT_NO_FSYNC` to bypass the buffer cache layer of the OS and avoid double caching.
   - Optimize the `innodb_io_capacity` and `innodb_io_capacity_max` settings according to your specific NVM performance characteristics.

3. **Memory Optimization:**
   - Ensure that the MySQL buffer pool (`innodb_buffer_pool_size`) is sized correctly, taking into account the available memory while leaving enough for the OS and other processes.
   - Configure the `innodb_log_buffer_size` to minimize disk I/O for transaction logs.

4. **Concurrency and Threads:**
   - Tune the `innodb_thread_concurrency`, `innodb_read_io_threads`, and `innodb_write_io_threads` to match the concurrency level your NVM can handle.
   - Optimize thread cache size (`thread_cache_size`) to improve client connection performance.

5. **Table Formats:**
   - Use the InnoDB table format, as it‚Äôs generally better suited for modern storage.

6. **Query Optimization:**
   - Regularly analyze queries using `EXPLAIN` or the MySQL slow query log to find and optimize inefficient queries.
   - Index optimization is crucial for performance; make sure indexes fit into memory and are properly utilized.

7. **Transaction Commit Settings:**
   - Adjust the `innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit` setting considering durability vs. performance trade-offs. NVM storage may allow for relaxed settings without a significant risk of data loss.

8. **Block Size and Alignment:**
   - Match the file system block size with the MySQL `innodb_page_size` for optimal performance.
   - Ensure proper alignment of partitions to take full advantage of the NVM's performance.

9. **Regular Maintenance:**
   - Run `OPTIMIZE TABLE` periodically to compact and rebuild tables, especially after substantial changes to data.
   - Keep the MySQL instance updated to benefit from performance improvements and bug fixes.

10. **Monitoring and Review:**
    - Regularly monitor I/O performance and throughput, using tools like `iostat`, to identify bottlenecks.
    - Utilize MySQL's performance schema and information_schema to collect performance data and fine-tune settings.

11. **Backup and Restore:**
    - Adjust backup strategies considering the high performance and consistency capabilities of NovaFS. Tools like `Percona XtraBackup` or `mysqldump` with appropriate options can be used.

Remember, the specific adjustments depend on the actual hardware and workload, so performance testing and tuning are iterative processes. Moreover, when dealing with file systems and storage architecture, constant benchmarking and profiling against your actual workload are essential to determine what works best in your particular scenario.
