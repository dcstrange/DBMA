An overview of the prevalent workloads based on the processes and status variables:
- The `SHOW PROCESSLIST` command indicates there's currently only one query active (besides the actual command to show process list), executed by the `root` user on the 'db' database.
- No slow queries have been recorded (`Slow_queries`: 0).

Please note that the current workload appears to be very light, and there are no signs of slow queries as of the information retrieved. The information above captures just a moment in time and might not be indicative of the typical workload on the database. For a comprehensive analysis, more in-depth and longer-duration monitoring would be required.

🐹 expert_perf_tuning 🗣️(responses to)  @dba_expert_team_leader
The current ACID configuration settings and snapshot of the 'DB_1' MySQL database instance can give us valuable insight into how to optimize it for the new NVM storage hardware (using NovaFS). Based on the settings and workloads you've described, here are some recommendations to consider:

1. **Buffer Pool Optimization:** 
    Since NVM storage offers high-speed I/O operations, you can potentially reduce the buffer pool size to better reflect the hardware's capability to read data quickly from the storage layer. However, this should be tested and benchmarked as a larger buffer may still provide performance benefits.

2. **Adaptive Flushing and Log File Size:**
    With NVM's lower latency, you can fine-tune the InnoDB's adaptive flushing and increase the size of the log files to take advantage of the swift write capabilities. Larger log files will allow more transactions to be written without frequent flushes.

3. **Doublewrite Buffer:**
    Typically, the doublewrite buffer is necessary to prevent data corruption. But with NVM that provides atomic writes, you could disable the doublewrite buffer to improve performance since atomic writes ensure durability without needing doublewrite.

4. **Transaction Log Flushing:**
    Since you have NVM storage, you can consider setting the `innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit` to 2. This flushes the log to the file system but not to the disk after each transaction, relying on the file system (in this case, NovaFS) to ensure data integrity.

5. **Thread Concurrency:**
    While NVM provides fast access, inefficiencies in CPU usage could bottleneck performance. InnoDB's thread concurrency should be tuned to match the system's number of CPU cores, reducing contention and ensuring efficient CPU usage.

6. **Change Buffering:**
    Change buffering could be more aggressively used for NVM storage, which would allow more changes to be buffered in memory and hence fewer writes to disk.

7. **Non-Blocking Commit Algorithm:**
    Look into InnoDB's `innodb_commit_concurrency` and `innodb_thread_concurrency` settings to see whether a non-blocking commit algorithm could be valuable in this environment.

8. **Monitoring and Metrics:**
    Investigate the performance counters for Buffer Pool Reads/Writes, Doublewrite Buffer Usage, and Fsyncs to spot if there are any bottlenecks appearing post-migration that weren't there before.

Remember to introduce these changes gradually and monitor their effect on your system. Benchmarks and stress tests, as well as an understanding of your specific workload, should guide you in tweaking these configurations to achieve optimal performance. These are advanced settings, and each of them can have significant effects on your database performance, so it is crucial to proceed with caution and consider consulting with your team’s database architecture experts for further insights.

Based on the recommendations provided by the Performance Tuning expert, here are detailed ACID configuration settings for optimizing the MySQL database instance 'DB_1' following its migration to NVM storage using NovaFS:

1. **Buffer Pool Optimization:**
   - Consider reducing the buffer pool size to align with NVM storage's ability to quickly read data, but only after careful testing and benchmarking.

2. **Adaptive Flushing and Log File Size:**
   - Fine-tune the InnoDB adaptive flushing and consider increasing the log files' size to benefit from NVM's swift write capabilities.

3. **Doublewrite Buffer:**
   - With NVM hardware providing atomic writes, consider disabling the doublewrite buffer to enhance performance without compromising data integrity.

4. **Transaction Log Flushing:**
   - Set `innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit` to 2 to flush logs to the file system (but not necessarily to disk) after each transaction, utilizing NovaFS's data integrity features.

5. **Thread Concurrency:**
   - Tune InnoDB's thread concurrency to match the system's CPU core count, reducing contention and maximizing CPU efficiency.

6. **Change Buffering:**
   - Use change buffering more aggressively to minimize disk writes and capitalize on NVM's speed.

7. **Non-Blocking Commit Algorithm:**
   - Review the `innodb_commit_concurrency` and `innodb_thread_concurrency` settings to explore the benefits of a non-blocking commit algorithm with NVM storage.

8. **Monitoring and Metrics:**
   - Monitor performance metrics such as Buffer Pool Reads/Writes, Doublewrite Buffer Usage, and Fsyncs to identify post-migration bottlenecks.

It's important to roll out these changes incrementally, closely observe their impact, and conduct benchmarks to guide adjustments for optimal performance. Additionally, these advanced settings could significantly affect database performance, necessitating careful consideration and potential discussion with database architecture experts for further insights.

        Explanation: ACID configurations may necessitate reviewing the database design in the context of the new storage hardware.
```

Based on the recommendations from the dba_expert_team_leader, here are the detailed ACID configuration settings for optimizing your MySQL database instance 'DB_1' since the migration to NVM storage using NovaFS:

1. **Buffer Pool Optimization**: It may be beneficial to reduce the buffer pool size given the faster read capabilities of NVM storage, but this should be verified with tests and benchmarks.

2. **Adaptive Flushing and Log File Size**: Consider fine-tuning InnoDB's adaptive flushing mechanisms and think about increasing the size of your log files to exploit the fast write capabilities of NVM.

3. **Doublewrite Buffer**: Disable the doublewrite buffer as NVM hardware offers atomic writes, potentially increasing performance without putting data integrity at risk.

4. **Transaction Log Flushing**: Adjust `innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit` to a setting of 2 to flush logs to the file system after each transaction which uses NovaFS's data integrity features without necessarily writing to disk immediately.

5. **Thread Concurrency**: Match InnoDB's thread concurrency with your system's CPU core count to reduce contention and fully utilize CPU resources.

6. **Change Buffering**: Utilize the change buffering more aggressively to lower the frequency of disk writes and make full use of the speed of NVM storage.

7. **Non-Blocking Commit Algorithm**: Explore benefits of a non-blocking commit algorithm by assessing the `innodb_commit_concurrency` and `innodb_thread_concurrency`.

8. **Monitoring and Metrics**: Keep an eye on performance metrics including Buffer Pool Reads/Writes, Doublewrite Buffer Usage, and Fsync counts to pinpoint any bottlenecks that might have appeared after the migration.

Remember to implement these changes gradually while diligently monitoring their impacts. Benchmarks should be used to guide further adjustments to achieve optimal performance. Also, keep in mind that changing these advanced settings can have significant impacts on database performance, so it might be useful to consider discussions with database architecture experts for more in-depth advice.
