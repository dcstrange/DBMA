Adjusting MySQL's configuration to take advantage of Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) storage hardware typically involves a combination of ACID-compliance adjustments, query optimization, caching enhancements, and performance-related settings. Given that NVM has a much lower latency and higher throughput compared to traditional storage, you can configure MySQL to optimize these benefits.

Here‚Äôs how you would approach using NVM storage hardware to accelerate MySQL performance while adhering to ACID properties:

### Query Optimization
- **Index Usage**: With the lower latency of NVM storage, the cost of accessing disk is reduced. However, efficient index usage is still crucial. You might find that different indexing strategies might be more appropriate with NVM as the storage bottleneck is significantly reduced.
- **Query Execution Plans**: Analyzing execution plans to ensure they are optimal for NVM. You might discover that certain query shapes perform differently due to the characteristics of NVM.

### Caching
- **InnoDB Buffer Pool**: Consider adjusting the InnoDB buffer pool size. Although NVM is fast, in-memory operations are still quicker. However, the buffer pool may not need to be as large as with traditional storage since the penalty for disk access is less severe.
- **Thread Cache**: The thread cache can be adjusted since thread creation and destruction can have a lower overhead with faster storage. This can affect connection pooling strategies.

### Performance Settings
- **InnoDB Flush Method**: The InnoDB flush method (`innodb_flush_method`) might be set to `O_DIRECT` or `O_DIRECT_NO_FSYNC` on traditional storage to reduce double buffering by the operating system. With NVM, you may benefit from alternative settings due to the differences in NVM technology.
- **Redo Logging and Write-Ahead Logging**: Tune InnoDB Redo Logging (`innodb_log_file_size` and `innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit`). With NVM, you can achieve durability with less performance overhead, so you might relax the flushing settings.
- **Binary Log Commit Sync**: If binary logging is enabled, you might adjust `sync_binlog` to a higher value or even 0 to rely on NVMs' durability guarantees, reducing the I/O wait.

### ACID Compliance Adjustments
- **Durability**: NVM can be seen as part of the memory hierarchy, which can shift how you think about data durability. The advantage of NVM is its ability to retain data through power outages.
- **Transaction Commit**: The commit time of a transaction can be improved on NVM due to its speed. However, careful consideration is needed to balance the risk of data loss against performance gains.

### Server Configurations
- **Concurrency Levels**: Adjust concurrency settings such as `innodb_thread_concurrency` and `innodb_concurrency_tickets` based on performance tests. NVM's faster access times may warrant higher concurrency settings.
- **I/O Capacity Settings**: Pay attention to `innodb_io_capacity` and `innodb_io_capacity_max`. These typically reflect the capabilities of the I/O subsystem, which are vastly different with NVM.

### System Factors
- **Filesystem Choice**: Choose a filesystem that is optimized for NVM to take full advantage of its performance characteristics.
- **NUMA Architecture**: For systems with NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) architecture, ensure that MySQL and its buffer pools are properly configured to avoid unnecessary remote memory access.

### Optimization Phases
You would typically follow these phases:
1. **Benchmarking**: Start by benchmarking current performance on traditional storage to provide a baseline.
2. **Migration**: Migrate MySQL to use NVM storage and re-benchmark.
3. **Adjustment Iterations**: Iteratively adjust MySQL settings, re-testing performance after each change.
4. **Monitoring**: Continuously monitor performance and make adjustments as needed.

Performing these configurations requires careful planning and testing, as well as considering the specific characteristics of the NVM hardware being used. It's also important to monitor the impact of these changes on the overall system's performance, ensuring that the ACID properties are preserved while taking full advantage of the lower latency and faster I/O capabilities offered by NVM storage.

When adjusting the MySQL database schema or design to maximize the performance benefits of using Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) storage hardware with NovaFS (a file system designed to leverage the high-speed characteristics of NVM), several factors should be considered:

1. **Data Access Patterns**:
   - **Random vs. Sequential**: NVM excels in random access due to low latency. Design tables and indexes to capitalize on this strength. 
   - **Read/Write Load**: Understand the read-to-write ratio. NVM has excellent read performance but might have different write endurance characteristics compared to traditional storage.

2. **Memory-Optimized Tables**:
   - Utilize MySQL‚Äôs memory-optimized tables where appropriate, as NVM can serve as an excellent backing store for in-memory databases, offering persistence without sacrificing speed.

3. **Concurrency and Locking**:
   - Given the low-latency, high-throughput nature of NVM, ensure that the database schema and transaction management are designed to minimize locking and increase concurrency.

4. **Indexing**:
   - Design efficient indexes that benefit from NVM‚Äôs quick access time. However, excessive indexing can lead to higher write amplification, which should be managed given the write endurance considerations of NVM.

5. **IO Patterns and Block Sizes**:
   - Align block sizes and IO patterns with the characteristics of NVM as its latency and throughput may be different compared to SSDs or HDDs. Avoid configurations that are tailored for mechanical drive latencies.

6. **Data Durability and Consistency**:
   - Evaluate the trade-offs between data durability and performance in the context of NVM. For instance, with NovaFS's asynchronous nature, consistency requirements should be balanced with performance considerations.

7. **Backup and Recovery**:
   - Modify backup and recovery procedures to exploit the high data transfer rates of NVM.

8. **Persistent Memory Programming Models**:
   - Consider using advanced programming models (e.g., the Persistent Memory Development Kit) for custom storage engines or UDFs that can directly leverage NVM's unique characteristics.

9. **Write Amplification**:
   - Be mindful of write amplification. Design the database to minimize unnecessary writes or updates that could degrade the NVM over time.

10. **Hardware and OS Considerations**:
    - Ensure that the hardware and operating system support NVM and are properly configured, as this can impact the performance seen by MySQL.

11. **Software Stack Compatibility**:
    - Confirm compatibility with the version of MySQL (or MariaDB, etc.) and any other parts of the software stack, ensuring they are optimized for NVM storage.

12. **Cache Management**:
    - Leverage MySQL's buffer pool and other caching mechanisms, but also assess how the caching strategy might change given NVM's characteristics.

13. **Schema Evolution**:
    - Plan for future changes in the schema that can incorporate optimizations for NVM without significant downtime or performance penalties.

14. **Monitoring and Tuning Tools**:
    - Utilize monitoring tools that can provide insights into how the NVM is being used by MySQL, and adjust configurations based on observed performance metrics.

15. **Cost-to-Benefit Analysis**:
    - Conduct a cost-to-benefit analysis to ensure that the increased performance aligns with the application's needs and the cost associated with NVM hardware.

Implementing these considerations requires a holistic approach that goes beyond simple schema changes and encompasses the entire stack from hardware to the application level. It may also necessitate collaboration with experts in storage systems, operating systems, and MySQL to ensure that all components are harmonized to leverage NVM effectively.

The Expert Group has provided a detailed set of guidelines covering both Performance Tuning and Data Modeling to help you adjust your current MySQL ACID configuration in light of your newly installed NVM storage hardware with NovaFS. Here are the expert recommendations:

### Performance Tuning:
1. **Query Optimization:** Index efficiently and analyze plans for optimization with NVM.
2. **Caching:** Balance buffer pool and thread cache settings with NVM's speed.
3. **Performance Settings:** Modify flush methods and logs for durability and to reduce I/O wait.
4. **ACID Adjustments:** Reconsider durability and transaction commits with NVM.
5. **Server Configurations:** Adapt concurrency and I/O settings based on NVM's faster access times.
6. **System Factors:** Optimize the filesystem for NVM and configure for NUMA, if applicable.
7. **Optimization Phases:** Benchmark, adjust iteratively, and monitor continuously.

### Data Modeling:
1. **Data Access Patterns:** Adjust for NVM's read/write load.
2. **Memory-Optimized Tables:** Use for persisted high-speed operations.
3. **Concurrency and Locking:** Design for minimal locking and increased concurrency with NVM's low latency.
4. **Indexing:** Index effectively while managing write endurance.
5. **IO Patterns:** Align with NVM's latency and throughput.
6. **Data Durability and Consistency:** Consider NovaFS‚Äôs and NVM‚Äôs characteristics.
7. **Backup and Recovery:** Update procedures for NVM's data transfer rates.
8. **Programming Models:** Use advanced models for custom engines.
9. **Write Amplification:** Minimize unnecessary writes.
10. **Hardware and OS:** Ensure compatibility.
11. **Software Stack:** Optimize for NVM storage.
12. **Cache Management:** Adjust for NVM's characteristics.
13. **Schema Evolution:** Plan for changes that optimize for NVM.
14. **Tuning Tools:** Utilize monitoring tools for NVM utilization.
15. **Cost-to-Benefit:** Do analysis to ensure benefits meet application needs.

Implementing these changes will require careful planning, testing, monitoring the impact on system performance, and ensuring that ACID properties are maintained. It is recommended to take an integrated approach considering the entire technology stack from hardware to the application level.

It appears that the user's message does not contain a request or inquiry related to MySQL Database Operations & Maintenance (O&M). Therefore, there is no actionable task or analysis to perform based on the user's statement. It seems to be an acknowledgment rather than a query or directive. If the user has a MySQL-related question or task, I would need more details to assist them further.
