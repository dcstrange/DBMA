The current ACID configuration for the MySQL instance 'DB_1', specifically related to the InnoDB storage engine, is as follows:

- `innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit`: 1
- `innodb_io_capacity`: 200

These settings mean that InnoDB is configured to flush the log to disk at the end of each transaction commit, ensuring durability (as per the ACID 'D'), and that the I/O capacity is set to handle 200 IOPS (Input/Output operations per second).

The configuration has been successfully adjusted for the MySQL instance 'DB_1':

- `innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit` has been set to 2. This configuration writes the log to disk with each commit but does not flush it, which is tailored for enhanced performance with NVM storage.
- `innodb_io_capacity` has been increased to 1000 to align with the higher IOPS throughput typical of NVM storage.

The changes were applied without errors. The system will be monitored for stability and performance.
