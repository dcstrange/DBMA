The ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) are critical for ensuring the reliability of transactions in a MySQL database. When migrating to NVM (Non-Volatile Memory) storage using NovaFS, there are factors to consider that can impact these properties. Here are some MySQL database settings and optimization recommendations specifically tailored for an environment that uses NVM storage:

1. **Innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit**:
   - On NVM storage, you may consider setting `innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit` to `1` to guarantee durability without a significant performance penalty typically associated with disk-based storage. This setting ensures the log is written and flushed to stable storage at each transaction commit.

2. **Innodb_buffer_pool_size**:
   - NVM storage typically has lower latency and higher throughput compared to traditional storage. The `innodb_buffer_pool_size` could be sized to be larger if there is enough RAM. However, consider that the advantage of having a vast buffer pool is less pronounced with NVM due to its fast I/O.

3. **Innodb_io_capacity** and **Innodb_io_capacity_max**:
   - These settings determine the I/O throughput capability of the system and both can be increased to match the higher performance characteristics of the NVM storage. Do test to find the optimal value.

4. **Innodb_log_file_size**:
   - With the high write endurance of NVM, you could afford to have a larger log file size, which reduces the checkpointing frequency and can lead to better transaction throughput.

5. **Innodb_log_buffer_size**:
   - Increasing `innodb_log_buffer_size` can reduce the need for writing log information to the log files before transactions commit, taking advantage of NVM's better write performance.

6. **Innodb_flush_method**:
   - Set `innodb_flush_method` to `O_DIRECT_NO_FSYNC` to bypass the double buffering effect in the Linux kernel. This flush method is effective for NVM since the risk of tearing is minimal and does not involve mechanical movement.

7. **Innodb_flush_neighbors**:
   - With faster access of NVM, the setting `innodb_flush_neighbors` could be set to `0` to not flush neighboring pages as the random read/write penalty is smaller.

8. **Binary Log and GTID**:
   - Ensure that binary logging is enabled with GTID for point-in-time recovery and replication consistency. Use `sync_binlog=1` to flush the binary log to disk after every commit. This will be faster with NVM.

9. **Filesystem optimizations**:
   - Consider filesystem options like `noatime` and `nodiratime` to reduce unnecessary metadata writes when reading files.

10. **Redo Log and Aria Pagecache**:
   - Adapt the Aria storage engine's pagecache and redo log settings to take advantage of the lower latency and higher throughput.

Note that while NVM storage offers high performance, it also has different characteristics compared to traditional spinning disks or even SSDs. Durability is less of a concern in terms of the need to flush data to disk since NVM maintains data even after a power loss. However, data still needs to be properly committed, so configurations that ensure atomicity and consistency should not be neglected.

Lastly, the specific recommendations can vary depending on the additional characteristics of the NVM hardware, the NovaFS filesystem's features, the MySQL version, and the workload itself. It could be beneficial to conduct benchmarking tests under realistic workloads to fine-tune these parameters for optimal performance while maintaining ACID compliance. Always ensure to backup your database before making significant configuration changes.

Based on the new NVM storage environment, here are some MySQL database settings and optimization recommendations specifically tailored for ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) configurations:

1. **Innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit**:
   - Set `innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit` to `1` to ensure the log is written and flushed to stable storage at each transaction commit, providing durability without the usual performance penalty.

2. **Innodb_buffer_pool_size**:
   - Considering NVM's lower latency and higher throughput, you might increase `innodb_buffer_pool_size` if you have enough RAM, although the advantage may be less pronounced with NVM due to its fast I/O.

3. **Innodb_io_capacity** and **Innodb_io_capacity_max**:
   - Adjust these settings to reflect the high I/O capabilities of NVM storage. Perform tests to find optimal values.

4. **Innodb_log_file_size**:
   - Increase `innodb_log_file_size` due to NVM's high write endurance, helping to improve transaction throughput by reducing checkpoint frequency.

5. **Innodb_log_buffer_size**:
   - Consider increasing `innodb_log_buffer_size` to leverage NVM's better write performance and minimize the frequency of log flushes before transactions commit.

6. **Innodb_flush_method**:
   - Use `O_DIRECT_NO_FSYNC` for `innodb_flush_method` to bypass double buffering in the Linux kernel, effective for NVM with minimal tearing risk.

7. **Innodb_flush_neighbors**:
   - Set `innodb_flush_neighbors` to `0` since NVM allows faster access and has a smaller penalty for random read/write operations.

8. **Binary Log and GTID**:
   - Enable binary logging with GTID for recovery and replication consistency. `sync_binlog=1` will ensure binary log flush after every commit, which is more efficient with NVM.

9. **Filesystem optimizations**:
   - Use options such as `noatime` and `nodiratime` on the filesystem to reduce metadata writes when accessing files.

10. **Redo Log and Aria Pagecache**:
   - Adjust Aria storage engine's pagecache and redo log settings to utilize NVM's performance benefits.

These recommendations are tailored to NVM storage which can maintain data even after power loss, rendering durability concerns different from traditional storage. That said, atomicity and consistency are still crucial, so configurations should not overlook these aspects.

Note that these recommendations may vary depending on the NVM hardware specifics, the features of the NovaFS filesystem, MySQL version, and the actual workload. Therefore, it is recommended to conduct realistic workload benchmark tests to fine-tune these parameters for optimal ACID compliance and performance. Prior to applying significant configuration changes, always back up your database.
