üë§ User: A fast-growing tech startup's database StartUpDB is experiencing growing pains. The user_data and product_usage tables are not keeping up with the rapid increase in users and data volume, requiring immediate scaling operations. Continuous monitoring and alerting systems need to be established for real-time performance tracking. Performance tuning is also essential to optimize current resource utilization.
