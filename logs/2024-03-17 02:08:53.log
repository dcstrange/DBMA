Request Analysis:
- Type: Performing O&M actions
  Rationale: The user is requesting to perform maintenance actions such as cleaning up dead tuples, which is a typical O&M task. Additionally, the user is looking to improve query performance on a specified database table.
  Topics:
  - Topic: Performance Tuning
    Explanation: Cleaning up dead tuples and improving query performance are both directly related to performance tuning of a database.
  - Topic: Troubleshooting
    Explanation: The need to clean up dead tuples and enhance query performance suggests there are underlying issues that require troubleshooting.
- Type: UNKNOWN
  Rationale: The request mentions PostgreSQL instead of MySQL, which is outside the scope of MySQL O&M tasks, so it is unclear if the user is mistakenly referring to PostgreSQL when they mean MySQL.
  Topics:
  - Topic: UNKNOWN
    Explanation: Since the request is about PostgreSQL, not MySQL, it does not match any of the predefined O&M topics for MySQL.
