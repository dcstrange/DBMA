Migrating a MySQL database instance to NVM (Non-Volatile Memory) storage hardware using NovaFS can significantly enhance database performance due to the high speed and low latency characteristics of NVM. When it comes to configuring MySQL for optimization with a focus on ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, there are several strategies and settings adjustments that you can consider:

1. **Optimize Storage Engine Configuration:**
   - Use the InnoDB storage engine, as it is designed to work well with ACID-compliant transactions and can take advantage of fast storage for optimized IO.
   - Adjust the `innodb_io_capacity` and `innodb_io_capacity_max` to match the NVM performance characteristics. These settings control the background IO rate for InnoDB.

2. **Adapt Buffer Pool Size:**
   - Set the `innodb_buffer_pool_size` to a larger value, taking advantage of the fast access speeds of NVM and ensuring data is kept in memory, reducing disk IO.

3. **Tune the Redo Log:**
   - With NVM, you can increase the size of the InnoDB redo log files (`innodb_log_file_size`) since the write latency is lower. A larger redo log may provide better performance for write-intensive applications.

4. **Optimize Commit Settings:**
   - Consider changing the `innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit` setting:
       - Set to `1` for full ACID compliance, ensuring durability but potentially reducing performance.
       - Set to `2` for better performance, committing to log but flushing to disk only once per second.
       - Set to `0` for the best performance, flushing to log and disk once per second, but with the trade-off of losing up to one second of transactions on crash.

5. **Transaction Isolation Levels:**
   - Review and select the appropriate transaction isolation level (`tx_isolation` or `transaction_isolation` in MySQL 8.0). Higher levels ensure better consistency but may impact performance.

6. **Concurrency Control:**
   - Use the `innodb_thread_concurrency` and `innodb_concurrency_tickets` settings to control how many threads can enter InnoDB concurrently.

7. **Binary Logging:**
   - If binary logging is enabled for replication or backup purposes (`log_bin`), make sure to set the `sync_binlog` variable:
      - A value of `1` ensures durability but impacts performance.
      - A higher value can improve performance at the cost of potential data loss in the event of a crash.

8. **Table Compression:**
   - NVM's fast access speed makes it suitable for using InnoDB table compression (`ROW_FORMAT=COMPRESSED`), which can save space and reduce IO, but be cautious with CPU overhead.

9. **Avoid Swapping:**
   - Ensure that the `vm.swappiness` parameter is set to a low value on the operating system to prevent swapping, which could negate the performance benefits of NVM.

10. **Routine Monitoring and Analysis:**
    - Monitor performance using tools like Prometheus and Grafana to collect and visualize metrics, watch for anomalies, and ensure that the system is performing as expected.

Remember to make changes incrementally and monitor the effects of each change carefully. Performance tuning can have different results depending on workload, data set size, and specific hardware capabilities. Additionally, always back up your database before making significant configuration changes.

For additional insights and final validation of these configuration optimizations, consider conferring with the operating system expert team, as some parameters like `vm.swappiness` are in the domain of operating system settings.

Certainly, optimizing ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties in a MySQL database after migration to a new NVM (Non-Volatile Memory) storage environment using NovaFS requires a multi-faceted approach focused on leveraging the advantages of high-speed storage technology. Here are database design considerations and configuration recommendations for each ACID property:

### Atomicity
- Utilize transaction logging and appropriate flush settings to ensure atomicity, especially since NVM can provide low latency for write operations.
- Choose the correct transaction isolation level (`READ COMMITTED`, `REPEATABLE READ`, etc.) depending on the application requirements to maintain atomicity without compromising performance.
- Configure `innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit` and related settings to balance between ACID compliance and performance. Lower values can improve performance but may risk atomicity in case of a crash.

### Consistency
- Ensure that foreign key constraints are defined and enabled to maintain referential integrity and consistency.
- Use InnoDB as the storage engine, as it is ACID-compliant by default and takes advantage of memory-efficient data structures that are suitable for NVM storage.
- Follow strict data typing and check constraints to enforce data consistency.
- Periodically run consistency checks using CHECK TABLE or mysqlcheck utility.

### Isolation
- Set the transaction isolation level appropriately to mitigate issues such as dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads. On NVM storage, the overhead of higher isolation may be less noticeable due to faster access times.
- InnoDB's MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control) can be configured to provide row-level locking with different levels of isolation. Test and tune this according to the workload and expected concurrency.

### Durability
- NovaFS, a file system designed for NVM, may provide optimized durability features such as reduced write amplification and better wear leveling.
- Review and configure InnoDB's page flushing and checkpointing parameters (e.g., `innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct`, `innodb_io_capacity`, etc.) to take full advantage of NVM's write endurance capabilities.
- Consider using MySQL's 'doublewrite buffer' to protect against partial page writes. However, with the durability guarantees of NVM, the need for it may be reduced.
- Utilize binlog and InnoDB's native capabilities to ensure data durability even in the event of power loss or system crashes.

### Additional Considerations
- Analyze the workloads to determine if there are any specific performance patterns that can be optimized through configuration changes.
- Update any storage-related variables in `my.cnf`/`mysqld.cnf`, such as `innodb_buffer_pool_size`, to maximize the utilization of the server's available RAM, as NVM can effectively complement high memory configurations.
- Consider implementing InnoDB's buffer pool instances to improve scalability and performance in multi-core systems.
- Regularly monitor the performance using tools like MySQL Enterprise Monitor or Performance Schema to understand the impact of configuration changes.

Since the migration introduces changes to the underlying storage, be sure to test thoroughly in a staging environment before moving to production. It is also advisable to profile application-specific database access patterns to make informed tuning decisions. Additionally, consult with both the database administration team and operating system specialists to ensure that the broader system configuration aligns with the new storage's capabilities.
