To optimize MySQL database instance 'DB_1' for its new NVM (Non-Volatile Memory) storage environment using NovaFS, we need to provide detailed settings and recommendations that enhance ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties. Here are the aspects that should be addressed:

1. **Atomicity**:
   - *Redo Log Configuration*: Ensure the redo log size is configured adequately. The redo log buffers transactions before they are persisted to the disk, securing atomicity. NVM storage can handle larger log files efficiently, so adjusting `innodb_log_file_size` might be beneficial.
   - *Logging Mechanism*: Configure the `innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit` parameter based on the desired level of atomicity and performance trade-offs. For instance, setting it to 1 provides full atomicity and durability but can be slower. If the NVM storage has power failure protection, setting it to 2 might be acceptable for increased performance.

2. **Consistency**:
   - *InnoDB Configuration*: Use the `innodb_strict_mode` to enforce strict SQL mode, which can help maintain consistency by avoiding problematic data entries.
   - *Foreign Key Checks*: If applicable, ensure that foreign key relationships are enforced by the database engine, which promotes referential integrity and consistency.
   
3. **Isolation**:
   - *Isolation Levels*: Choose the right transaction isolation level (`READ UNCOMMITTED`, `READ COMMITTED`, `REPEATABLE READ`, or `SERIALIZABLE`). `REPEATABLE READ` is the default for InnoDB and strikes a balance between consistency and performance.
   - *Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC)*: InnoDB's MVCC helps provide transaction isolation. The faster IO on NVM may allow for higher concurrency settings, so reviewing and adjusting `innodb_thread_concurrency` may be advantageous.

4. **Durability**:
   - *Durability Settings*: Ensuring durability involves flushing data changes to permanent storage. Re-evaluate durability-related configurations, such as `innodb_flush_method`, to take full advantage of NVM performance.
   - *Double Write Buffer*: Use the doublewrite buffer (`innodb_doublewrite`) to avoid data corruption. This setting can be reviewed because NVM might have built-in power failure protection, but consider trade-offs between data safety and IO overhead.

In addition to the above configurations, pay attention to:

- *Storage Engine*: Ensure that the InnoDB engine is used as it provides full ACID compliance.
- *Table Formats*: Verify the table formats (such as `ROW_FORMAT=DYNAMIC` or `COMPRESSED`) to ensure efficient data storage and retrieval on NVM storage.

Monitoring and Analysis Tools:
- Utilize the performance schema and Information Schema to monitor and retrieve runtime information about the storage engine and other MySQL internals, which can assist in further tuning.

Safety Measures:
- Before making changes to a live production system, test the configurations in a development or testing environment with similar NVM storage.

Please consider these as starting points for tuning MySQL to match the ACID properties with respect to the NVM storage environment. It may be necessary to adapt the settings as per the workload characteristics, and observing the system's behavior after any change is crucial to validate the impact. Additionally, always back up your configurations and data before making changes, to allow for a rollback if needed.

To optimize the MySQL database instance 'DB_1' for its new NVM (Non-Volatile Memory) storage environment using NovaFS while enhancing the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, consider the following recommendations:

### 1. Atomicity:
- **Redo Log Configuration**: Configure the redo log size appropriately (`innodb_log_file_size`). NVM storage can handle larger log files efficiently, which could improve atomic operations.
- **Logging Mechanism**: Optimize the `innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit` parameter to balance atomicity with performance. Setting this to 1 ensures full atomicity at the cost of performance, while setting it to 2 could boost performance if your NVM storage has adequate power failure protection.

### 2. Consistency:
- **InnoDB Configuration**: Enforce strict SQL mode with `innodb_strict_mode` to maintain consistency by avoiding problematic data entries.
- **Foreign Key Checks**: Ensure that foreign key relationships are enforced, which promotes referential integrity and consistency.

### 3. Isolation:
- **Isolation Levels**: Choose a suitable transaction isolation level. Although `REPEATABLE READ` is the default for InnoDB, consider your specific use case.
- **Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC)**: The fast IO of NVM may support higher concurrency settings. Review and adjust `innodb_thread_concurrency` as needed.

### 4. Durability:
- **Durability Settings**: Reassess durability-related configurations, such as `innodb_flush_method`, to utilize the full performance potential of NVM.
- **Double Write Buffer**: Evaluate the need for the doublewrite buffer (`innodb_doublewrite`). Although this protects against data corruption, NVM might have built-in power failure protection, and this setting could introduce unnecessary IO overhead.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Storage Engine**: Confirm the use of the InnoDB engine for full ACID compliance.
- **Table Formats**: Check table formats like `ROW_FORMAT=DYNAMIC` or `COMPRESSED` for efficient data storage and access with NVM storage.

### Monitoring and Analysis Tools:
- Use performance schema and Information Schema for real-time monitoring and retrieving insights on MySQL internals, assisting further fine-tuning.

### Safety Measures:
- Always backup your data and configurations before applying changes, and initially test in a non-production environment to validate the impact.

Implement these recommendations as a starting point and adapt the settings based on workload characteristics and system behavior after changes. Monitoring the system post-modification is crucial to ensure the desired outcomes.

The MySQL database expert group has provided detailed settings and optimization recommendations for optimizing the ACID configuration of your "DB_1" MySQL database instance in the new NVM storage environment. Below are the recommendations:

### 1. Atomicity:
- **Redo Log Configuration**: Adjust the redo log size (`innodb_log_file_size`) to leverage the efficiency of larger log files on NVM storage.
- **Logging Mechanism**: Fine-tune the `innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit` parameter to balance atomicity with performance. A value of 1 ensures the highest atomicity but may affect performance.

### 2. Consistency:
- **InnoDB Configuration**: Use strict SQL mode (`innodb_strict_mode`) to prevent problematic data entrants and maintain database consistency.
- **Foreign Key Checks**: Keep foreign key relationships enforced for referential integrity and consistency.

### 3. Isolation:
- **Isolation Levels**: Select an appropriate transaction isolation level according to use case requirements.
- **MVCC Settings**: With the fast I/O capabilities of NVM, consider tuning `innodb_thread_concurrency` for your database's needs.

### 4. Durability:
- **Durability Settings**: Reexamine configurations such as `innodb_flush_method` to align with the performance capabilities of NVM.
- **Double Write Buffer**: Question the necessity of the doublewrite buffer (`innodb_doublewrite`) depending on the power failure protection of the NVM.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Storage Engine**: Ensure you're using the InnoDB storage engine to fully benefit from ACID properties.
- **Table Formats**: Check if table formats like `ROW_FORMAT=DYNAMIC` or `COMPRESSED` are advantageous for your use of NVM storage.

### Monitoring and Analysis Tools:
- Utilize performance schema and Information Schema to monitor and gain insights for incremental fine-tuning.

### Safety Measures:
- Back up your data before applying changes and validate modifications in a controlled environment.

These recommendations are provided as a starting point. Continuous performance monitoring post-implementation is recommended to adjust settings as necessary for optimal performance.
