üë§ User üó£Ô∏è @task_intention
üë§ User: The MegaShopDB eCommerce platform on DB_Server_ECom is expected to experience sluggish performance during the January 1, 2024 sale. The platform requires performance tuning due to slow query response for the product_listings and customer_orders tables.. The user base and visits are expected to grow to twice the current level on January 1, 2024, and the platform needs to handle the increased traffic. It is required that the end-to-end latency of the database remains the same for all users on January 1, 2024, and that the budget does not exceed twice the current level.

# Step 1. **Initial Request Analysis**:
- **Objective**: Analyze and extract relevant types of the user's request.
- **Method**:
    - Analyze and extract relevant types of the user's request.
- **Output**:
    - Fact Retrieval: The user has not requested any specific information or data, so this type is not applicable.
    - Root cause analysis: There is no request to identify the primary cause of an existing issue, but there is a request to preemptively address potential problems, so this type is potentially relevant.
    - Performing O&M actions: The user specifically requires actions to be performed for performance tuning and ensuring the platform can handle increased traffic.

### User request analysis output:
- Type: Root cause analysis
    - Rationale: The user anticipates an issue with sluggish performance due to increased traffic and requires preemptive analysis and action to prevent this.
- Type: Performing O&M actions
    - Rationale: The user specifically asks for performance tuning to handle an expected increase in traffic and user base.

# Step 2. **O&M Topic Extraction**:
- **Objective**: Identify and extract relevant O&M topics from the user request.
- **Method**:
    - Review the user's request for keywords or phrases.
- **Output**:
    - Performance Tuning: This topic is directly mentioned, relating to slow query response and the need to handle increased traffic while maintaining end-to-end latency.
    - Scaling Operations: The user expects the user base and visits to grow to twice the current level, which relates to scaling the platform's capabilities.

### User request analysis output:
- Topic: Performance Tuning
    - Explanation: The user mentions the need for performance tuning due to slow query response times and the requirement to maintain the current level of latency.
- Topic: Scaling Operations
    - Explanation: There is an expected growth in the user base and visits, indicating the need to scale the database to accommodate this increase in traffic.

# Step 3. **Generate User's Request Analysis YAML Results**:
```
Request Analysis:
- Type: Root cause analysis
    Rationale: The user is expecting future performance issues and requires analysis to preempt and address these potential problems.
    Topics:
    - Topic: Performance Tuning
        Explanation: The user has identified the need for improved query response times to handle upcoming increased demands on the system.
    - Topic: Scaling Operations
        Explanation: The platform requires adjustments to manage an anticipated doubling in user base and visits.

- Type: Performing O&M actions
    Rationale: The request clearly necessitates specific O&M tasks to ensure the platform manages the increased traffic without an increase in latency or significant budget increase.
    Topics:
    - Topic: Performance Tuning
        Explanation: Actions need to be taken to tune the performance of the platform in preparation for the expected sale event.
    - Topic: Scaling Operations
        Explanation: The operational capability of the platform must scale up to support a growing number of users and the corresponding traffic load.

```
# Step 4. **User Interaction**:
- Ensure that Request Analysis is sent to the user before proceeding.
- Ask the user if he/she approves of the analysis results.
