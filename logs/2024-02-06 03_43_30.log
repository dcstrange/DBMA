üë§ User: Requires you to perform a system overhaul for EduDataDB on the university server DB_Server_Edu. This includes migrating the student_records and course_catalog databases to a new server, DB_Server_EduNew, and updating the data model to better meet the evolving educational structure. Following the migration, you will also be required to conduct a full security audit to ensure that student data is protected in accordance with new privacy laws.
