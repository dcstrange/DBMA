üë§ User: I have installed NVM storage hardware with NovaFS, how do I adjust my current MySQL ACID configuration for additional performance acceleration? Hint, maybe this requires the involvement of a panel of OS experts to provide some OS vision and knowledge.

As an Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Team Leader in MySQL Database, I would need the actual user request and the accompanying Request Analysis in YAML format to proceed with analyzing, planning, and assigning tasks to various database experts within the team.

Please provide the user's request and the request analysis in YAML format so that I can effectively manage and coordinate the team to handle the MySQL database operations and maintenance tasks.
