When tuning MySQL to take advantage of new NVM (Non-Volatile Memory) storage hardware using NovaFS (a file system specifically designed for NVM), you should consider the following steps and best practices:

1. **Assess Current Performance Baseline:**
   Before making changes, establish a performance baseline. This would involve:
   - Monitoring current disk I/O performance.
   - Analyzing the workload and query performance.
   - Capturing metrics such as throughput, latency, and IOPS.

2. **Update MySQL to a Version that Supports NVM:**
   - Ensure that you are running a version of MySQL that fully supports optimizations for NVM hardware.
   - Use the latest stable release to benefit from the most recent improvements.

3. **Configure InnoDB Storage Engine for NVM:**
   InnoDB is the default MySQL storage engine. Optimize it for NVM by:
   - Adjusting the `innodb_io_capacity` and `innodb_io_capacity_max` to reflect the higher IOPS capabilities of NVM.
   - Tweaking the `innodb_flush_method` parameter to take advantage of lower-latency writes.
   - Modifying the `innodb_log_file_size` and `innodb_log_buffer_size` to optimize log writes and minimize disk flushes.

4. **File System Optimizations:**
   - Use the features of NovaFS to minimize latency and maximize throughput.
   - Disable access-time updates on the file system (`noatime` mount option) to reduce unnecessary write operations.
   - Use filesystem-level options that leverage NVM characteristics.

5. **Adjust MySQL ACID Compliance Settings:**
   - If strict ACID compliance can be slightly relaxed, consider adjusting `innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit`. For example, setting it to `2` can improve performance while still ensuring the integrity of the logs in case of a crash.
   - Experiment with the `sync_binlog` parameter to balance between durability and performance.

6. **Hardware Alignment:**
   - Align MySQL's memory and I/O operations with the native page size of NVM to reduce overhead.

7. **Optimize Schema and Queries:**
   - If possible, redesign the schema to leverage NVM, including more efficient use of indexes.
   - Profile and optimize queries to reduce I/O and CPU utilization.

8. **Benchmarking and Testing:**
   - After making configuration changes, perform comprehensive benchmarking and load testing.
   - Compare the new performance metrics to the baseline to confirm improvements.
   - Ensure that the changes do not cause any regression in data integrity or durability.

9. **Monitoring and Fine-tuning:**
   - Continuously monitor the system using tools like Prometheus/Grafana.
   - Observe the effects of configuration changes and fine-tune as necessary based on real workload performance data.

10. **Consult MySQL Documentation and Expertise:**
    - Always refer to the MySQL documentation, as it will provide the most current and accurate information and guidelines.
    - Seek the advice of database performance experts when making significant changes to ensure best practices are followed.

11. **Backup and Recovery:**
    - Make sure you have a robust backup and recovery solution in place, and test your backup strategy before making any changes. NVM can change the dynamics of data recovery.

It is crucial to tailor the MySQL database configuration to the specific characteristics of NVM storage, as well as the individual use case, to fully benefit from the improved performance potential of the new hardware. Keep in mind that changes might differ based on the specific requirements and the version of MySQL in use. Always back up your data before making significant changes to the system.
