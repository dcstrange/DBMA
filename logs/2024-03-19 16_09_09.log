To achieve performance acceleration in MySQL using new NVM (Non-Volatile Memory) storage hardware with NovaFS (a file system designed to take advantage of NVM), the following ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) configurations can be adjusted:

1. **InnoDB Engine Settings**:
   - **innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit**: Adjusting this setting can have a significant impact on performance:
     - Set to `1` for full ACID compliance, where the log buffer is written to the log file after each transaction commit and the log file is flushed to the NVM storage.
     - Set to `2` to flush the log to the file system cache but not to the NVM, improving performance but with a slight durability risk.
     - Set to `0` to write and flush once per second, offering the best performance, but with more potential for data loss.
   - **innodb_io_capacity** and **innodb_io_capacity_max**: Increase these settings to match the high performance of NVM. This tells InnoDB how many I/O operations it should assume the storage can handle, which can be much higher for NVM devices.

2. **Binary Logging**:
   - For replication setups, binary logs used for replication can be tuned.
   - **sync_binlog**: By default (`1`), the MySQL server flushes the binary log to disk after every commit. Setting it to `0` can enhance performance but affects durability.

3. **Transaction Isolation Level**:
   - Lowering the transaction isolation level can increase performance at the cost of reduced isolation. For example, changing from `REPEATABLE READ` to `READ COMMITTED`.

4. **Doublewrite Buffer**:
   - **innodb_doublewrite**: NVM may have better write endurance, thus you can consider disabling the doublewrite buffer (`0`) to improve throughput.

5. **Redo Logging**:
   - **innodb_flush_method**: Set this to `O_DIRECT_NO_FSYNC` on NVM to reduce the number of fsyncs called.
   - Adjust the size of the **innodb_log_file_size** based on the transaction workload and the speed of NVM.

6. **Tablespaces**:
   - Place active InnoDB tablespaces on the NVM device to take advantage of its low-latency and high IOPS capabilities.

7. **Checkpointing**:
   - **innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct**: Adjust the threshold for the maximum percentage of dirty pages in the InnoDB buffer pool before a checkpoint is triggered. With NVM, you may tolerate a higher percentage due to the faster write capabilities of the storage.

8. **General Buffer Sizes**:
   - **innodb_buffer_pool_size**: On NVM hardware, you may allocate a larger buffer pool size considering the potentially larger capacity of NVM and its rapid access times.

Remember to test any changes in a staging environment before applying them in a production environment.

To adjust these settings, you'll typically edit the MySQL configuration file (`my.cnf` or `my.ini`), often located in the `/etc/mysql/` or `/etc` directory on the server.

Please let me know if you would need assistance in applying these settings, and I can provide instructions for interacting with the database environment.

üê¶ dba_expert_team_leader üó£Ô∏è(responses to)  @task_intention
To enhance your MySQL database performance using new NVM storage hardware with NovaFS effectively, you can make several adjustments to the ACID configurations. Here are the recommended steps for performance tuning:

1. **InnoDB Engine Settings**:
   - `innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit`: Consider the trade-off between performance and durability when setting its value. A value of `2` can improve performance with some durability risks.
   - `innodb_io_capacity` and `innodb_io_capacity_max`: Increase these to reflect the high I/O capabilities of NVM storage.

2. **Binary Logging**:
   - Adjust `sync_binlog` to `0` for performance, if replication durability can be slightly compromised.

3. **Transaction Isolation Level**:
   - Lower the level to `READ COMMITTED` for better performance, if application logic allows.

4. **Doublewrite Buffer**:
   - Consider disabling (`innodb_doublewrite = 0`) if NVM's write endurance permits.

5. **Redo Logging**:
   - Use `O_DIRECT_NO_FSYNC` for `innodb_flush_method` to minimize fsync calls on NVM.
   - Reevaluate `innodb_log_file_size` based on transaction workload and NVM speed.

6. **Tablespaces**:
   - Relocate active tablespaces to the NVM device to benefit from its high performance.

7. **Checkpointing**:
   - Adjust `innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct` to a higher percentage if NVM's fast writing capacity allows.

8. **Buffer Sizes**:
   - Consider increasing `innodb_buffer_pool_size` due to NVM's rapid access times and potential larger capacity. 

For implementing these changes, you will need to modify the MySQL configuration file (usually `my.cnf` or `my.ini`). Always test configuration adjustments in a staging environment before deploying to production to minimize potential issues.

Would you like guidance on how to apply these changes to your MySQL environment, or do you require further assistance with these suggestions?
