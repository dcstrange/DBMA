👤 User 🗣️ @task_intention
👤 User: The MegaShopDB eCommerce platform on DB_Server_ECom is expected to experience sluggish performance during the January 1, 2024 sale. The platform requires performance tuning due to slow query response for the product_listings and customer_orders tables.. The user base and visits are expected to grow to twice the current level on January 1, 2024, and the platform needs to handle the increased traffic. It is required that the end-to-end latency of the database remains the same for all users on January 1, 2024, and that the budget does not exceed twice the current level.
