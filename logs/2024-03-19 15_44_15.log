Adjusting MySQL's ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) configuration to take advantage of Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) storage hardware with the Nova File System (NovaFS) for performance acceleration primarily involves focusing on two aspects: storage engine configuration and transaction log handling. Here's a high-level guideline on what you can do:

1. **Choose the Right Storage Engine**: 
   - With NVM storage like NovaFS, the InnoDB storage engine is typically the best choice as it is designed to work efficiently with write-ahead logging and transaction support. Ensure that InnoDB is the default storage engine.

2. **InnoDB File Format and File-Per-Table**:
   - Use the Barracuda InnoDB file format and enable the `innodb_file_per_table` option to fully utilize the fast I/O capabilities of NVM storage.

3. **Fine-Tune InnoDB Buffer Pool**:
   - Because NVM is much faster than traditional disk-based storage, you might not need as large an InnoDB buffer pool. Experiment with smaller buffer pool sizes to find the optimal configuration.

4. **Optimize Redo Log (Write-Ahead Logging)**:
   - Place the InnoDB redo log files on the NVM storage. Since the redo log is write-intensive, the NVM's low latency can significantly improve transaction throughput.
   - Configure the size of the redo log files (`innodb_log_file_size`) properly to balance between recovery time and write performance.

5. **Adjust Doublewrite Buffer**:
   - Reconsider the necessity of the InnoDB doublewrite buffer (`innodb_doublewrite`). With reliable NVM storage, you might disable it to increase performance, but this may come with added risks that need to be evaluated.

6. **Tune the InnoDB Flush Method**:
   - The flush method (`innodb_flush_method`) can be set to `O_DIRECT_NO_FSYNC` on NVM to reduce I/O operation overhead by bypassing some of the operating system cache layers.

7. **Careful Handling of fsync**:
   - Minimizing `fsync` calls (`innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit`) can improve performance, but this may impact durability. With NVM, durability concerns can be lower due to the persistent nature of NVM storage.
   - A setting of `1` gives full ACID compliance, while `2` may improve performance by only flushing to OS cache on each commit.

8. **Concurrency and Thread Tuning**:
   - Adjust the concurrency settings like `innodb_thread_concurrency`, `innodb_read_io_threads`, and `innodb_write_io_threads` to take advantage of the NVM's fast response times.

9. **Monitoring and Testing**:
   - Continuously monitor performance metrics using tools like Prometheus and Grafana to understand the impact of configuration changes.
   - Conduct stress testing to ensure that the adjustments are providing the desired performance benefits without compromising ACID properties.

Please remember that while NVM can provide significant performance improvements due to decreased latency and increased throughput, it's also critical to maintain the balance between performance and the ACID properties essential for database integrity and consistency. Always back up your database before making substantial configuration changes, and thoroughly test these changes in a development or staging environment prior to moving them to production.

The Performance Tuning expert has provided a detailed guide on adjusting MySQL's ACID configuration to leverage the performance benefits of using Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) storage hardware with NovaFS. Here are the suggested actions:

1. **Select InnoDB Storage Engine**: Ensure InnoDB is set as the default engine for its efficiency with write-ahead logging and transactions.

2. **Use Barracuda File Format**: Opt for Barracuda InnoDB file format alongside `innodb_file_per_table` to maximize I/O capabilities.

3. **Optimize InnoDB Buffer Pool**: NVM's fast access allows for potentially smaller buffer pool sizes; experimentation is necessary to find the optimal size.

4. **Configure Redo Log**: Place InnoDB redo log files on NVM storage and properly set their sizes with `innodb_log_file_size` for a balance of recovery time and performance.

5. **Reevaluate Doublewrite Buffer**: With reliable NVM storage, disabling InnoDB's `innodb_doublewrite` may improve performance but assess the associated risks carefully.

6. **Tune Flush Method**: Set `innodb_flush_method` to `O_DIRECT_NO_FSYNC` to reduce overhead in I/O operations on NVM.

7. **Minimize fsync Calls**: Adjust `innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit` considering that reduced `fsync` calls can enhance performance, but the level of durability achieved must be acceptable.

8. **Adjust Concurrency and Threading**: Modify settings like `innodb_thread_concurrency`, `innodb_read_io_threads`, and `innodb_write_io_threads` to benefit from NVM's fast response times.

9. **Monitor and Test Changes**: Use performance monitoring tools and perform stress tests to confirm the effectiveness of configuration changes and their impact on ACID properties.

It's crucial to maintain a balance between enhancement in performance and adherence to ACID principles critical for the database's integrity. Always backup the database before implementing significant configuration changes and initially evaluate these changes in a non-production environment to ensure stability.
