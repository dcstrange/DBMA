👤 User 🗣️ @task_intention
👤 User: Requires you to perform a system overhaul for EduDataDB on the university server DB_Server_Edu. This includes migrating the student_records and course_catalog databases to a new server, DB_Server_EduNew, and updating the data model to better meet the evolving educational structure. Following the migration, you will also be required to conduct a full security audit to ensure that student data is protected in accordance with new privacy laws.

The educational structure is updated to introduce a more flexible and accessible framework, emphasizing streamlined course offerings and straightforward student progress tracking.
Core Components:
Simplified Modular Courses:
Courses are divided into essential modules that cover fundamental topics. Each module can be completed independently, offering students a clear and manageable path through their courses.
Hybrid Learning Options:
Every course is available in both online and in-person formats. Students can choose their preferred learning mode at the beginning of each term, providing flexibility to accommodate different learning styles and life circumstances.
Enhanced Student Records:
Student records are updated to track completed modules, chosen learning modes (online or in-person), and overall progress towards degree completion. This allows for easy monitoring of student achievements and course completions.

In order to assist with your request regarding MySQL Database, I would need to have the specific details of your request, and the Request Analysis provided to me in YAML format. 

Once I have that information, I will be able to review, categorize the types of requests, and determine the appropriate actions and the experts within my team to handle them. Please provide the details of your request and the accompanying Request Analysis.

It seems there was a misunderstanding, and I need the actual user's MySQL Database O&M task request and the Request Analysis in YAML format to proceed further. 

Could you please provide me with your initial request regarding the MySQL Database O&M task once more? This will allow me to interact with the Expert Group accurately and assist you with your requirements.
