The current InnoDB storage engine configuration, specifically the parameters related to I/O performance, are as follows:
- `innodb_io_capacity`: 200
- `innodb_io_capacity_max`: 2000

The InnoDB data files and logs configuration show that:
- `datadir` is located at `/var/lib/mysql/`
- `innodb_data_home_dir` is not set (indicating it uses the default, which is the same as `datadir`)
- `innodb_log_group_home_dir` is set to `./` (indicating it uses the default directory for log files which is `datadir` as well)

From the results of analyzing the OS system environment, there is no indication that the mounted filesystem is using NVM with NovaFS. The mounted filesystems are primarily `ext4` and `squashfs` types with no mention of NovaFS. The `df -Th` command output does not display an NVM storage file system, and `lsblk --fs` for `/dev/sda1` (which is where the MySQL data directory is located) indicates `ext4` rather than an NVM-specific filesystem likely associated with NovaFS. 

Therefore, based on the given information, InnoDB data files and logs do not appear to be located on the newly installed NVM storage with NovaFS.
