As the expert, my main tasks or suggestions would be:

1. Scale Up: This is the most basic way to scale a database by simply adding more resources. This might mean upgrading to a server with more RAM, faster CPUs or SSDs. However, this method only works up to a certain point, beyond which you'll need to look into more advanced solutions.

2. Sharding: This involves splitting your tables across multiple databases. Each database only contains a slice (or shard) of your data, which can greatly improve query times. With sharding, you must carefully select the sharding key to distribute the data evenly across all shards.

3. Replication: By creating duplicate copies of your database you can handle more queries. This can be done using MySQL's built-in replication functionality. The master database handles all writes, while slaves handle reads. However, this can lead to consistency issues.

4. Clustering: This involves grouping together several databases to work as a single unit. All databases in the cluster are identical, and any changes are immediately propagated to the others. MySQL supports clustering via the InnoDB storage engine.

5. Partitioning: This is the process of splitting large tables into smaller, more manageable pieces called partitions. Partitions can be based on certain criteria like date ranges, hash values, etc. MySQL supports table partitioning natively via the ALTER TABLE command.

6. Use Cloud Services: Many cloud providers offer scalable database services which easily scale in response to demands. These services, like Amazon RDS or Google Cloud SQL, can automatically handle many of the scaling issues allowing you to focus on your application.

7. Optimizing Queries and Indexes: An optimized query can reduce the load and increase the database capacity. Similarly, properly created and managed indexes can help in increasing the scaling features of the database.

8. Caching: Caching frequently queried data can drastically reduce the load on a database. Tools like Redis or Memcached can be used.

Perform a thorough evaluation of each, considering current data volume, anticipated growth, budget, and teams' skills to determine the best approach for scaling. Sequencing the scaling improvements will likely minimize disruptions and ensure continuous upgrades.

In addition, invest in monitoring and alerting tools as these will help you track the progress and efficiency of your scaling efforts.

üê∂ ExpertMonitor ‚öôÔ∏èFunction Output
In order to achieve continuous monitoring and alerting for a database, you will have to combine various tools and processes.

1. **Decide on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: Identify the main metrics that are important for tracking your database's performance such as query execution times, CPU usage, memory usage etc.

2. **Choose Appropriate Monitoring Tools**: Choose a database monitoring tool that can monitor these metrics in real-time. Some popular monitoring tools include SolarWinds, AppDynamics, and Datadog. Other open source tools like Prometheus and Grafana can also be used. 

3. **Set Up Alerts**: The monitoring tool you choose should also support real-time alerting for when your database metrics exceed or fall below the given thresholds. These alerts can be delivered through email, SMS or even through integration with incident management tools like PagerDuty.

4. **Create Dashboards**: Build custom dashboards on your monitoring tools to visualize your data and make it easy to understand and interpret. This will help you quickly identify and solve issues as they arise.

5. **Regular Audits & Maintenance**: Regularly check your monitoring setup to ensure that it's correctly capturing and alerting on your key metrics. As your system grows and evolves, you'll need to add or adjust your metrics and thresholds accordingly.

6. **Implement Automatic Scaling**: If possible, implement automatic scaling based on performance metrics to ensure that your database can handle high load situations without manual intervention. 

7. **Backup and Recovery Procedures**: Regularly back up your data and ensure that you have a recovery process in place. Monitoring systems should already alert you to any failures.

8. **Regular Training & Reviews**: Ensure your team members are trained to respond to alerts and understand the architecture of your database system well. Also regular reviews of your monitoring setup would be beneficial for determining any improvements that can be made. 

Remember, setting up monitoring and alerting systems isn't a one-time task. It needs regular maintenance to ensure everything runs smoothly.

üê∂ ExpertPerfTuning ‚öôÔ∏èFunction Output
Performance tuning of a database requires a professional with a deep understanding of SQL queries, database architecture, and various performance metrics. Improving a database's performance involves rewriting inefficient SQL queries for optimization, managing database resources effectively, and tuning database settings.

The primary responsibilities of a Database Performance Tuner include:

1. Analyzing and Enhancing Database Performance: Regularly evaluating the performance metrics of the database and identifying areas of potential improvement.

2. Conducting Stress Testing: Implementing and executing stress tests on the database to examine its performance under various load situations. The test results are then analyzed to locate any performance issues.

3. Optimizing Server Settings: Regulating server configurations to improve performance. The impact of these adjustments should be continually monitored and adjusted accordingly.

Furthermore, a good understanding of indexing strategies is key to speeding up query execution, while competent management and adjustment of caching mechanisms can also significantly enhance performance.

üê∂ ExpertScaling ‚öôÔ∏èFunction Output
For the 'user_data' table, an appropriate partition key could be the 'user_id'. This column is likely used frequently in WHERE clause conditions, making it ideal for partitioning. As user ID distribution is usually not uniform, RANGE partitioning may not be the best choice. Instead, HASH partitioning using the user_id can evenly distribute rows amongst various partitions.

Example:
ALTER TABLE user_data PARTITION BY HASH(user_id) PARTITIONS 16;

For the 'product_usage' table, decision on partition key depends on the access pattern. If the table is often queried for a specific time period (e.g., daily product usage or monthly product usage), 'usage_date' could be a good partition key and RANGE partitioning can work well in this case.

Example:
ALTER TABLE product_usage PARTITION BY RANGE (YEAR(usage_date)*100 + MONTH(usage_date)) (
   PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN (202001), 
   PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (202002), 
   PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN (202003),
   ...
);

As for partition count, it depends on the number of records and the hardware. Too few partitions and we risk having a skewed distribution. Too many partitions could result in a system overhead for managing these partitions. Thus, determining the right number needs careful monitoring and testing. 

Remember that MySQL has a limit of 8192 partitions per table, although for performance reasons it's recommended not to exceed a few hundred partitions. 

Finally, make sure to monitor and adjust your partition strategy as data volume and access patterns evolve.

1. **Installation of mysqld_exporter**
The first thing you need to do is download and install mysqld_exporter. You can achieve this by navigating to the official GitHub page of the exporter and following the installation instructions.

2. **Setup of mysqld_exporter**
After the installation, mysqld_exporter needs to be properly configured to expose the MySQL metrics. An important configuration involves setting up the MySQL server's address, username, and password that the exporter uses to connect to the database.

3. **Prometheus Configuration**
Next, we need to inform Prometheus about the mysqld_exporter. This is done in the Prometheus configuration file, where we define a new scrape job. The job should include the address (IP and port) where mysqld_exporter is running.

4. **Define Scraping Intervals**
Prometheus needs to know how often it should scrape the MySQL metrics from mysqld_exporter. This is defined in the scrape_configs section of the Prometheus configuration file.

5. **Setting Up Alert Rules**
Prometheus also enables setting up alert rules. If certain conditions (e.g., database down, high memory usage) are met, Prometheus sends an alert message so that you can intervene promptly.

6. **Integration with Grafana**
Lastly, for a better graphical representation of the collected metrics, it's recommended to use Grafana. You just need to add Prometheus as a data source in Grafana. Then, you create a new dashboard and choose which metrics you want to display. The metrics are in form of time series data which can be represented in various types of graphs.

By following these steps, you successfully integrate MySQL with Prometheus and Grafana. This way, the monitoring of the MySQL database becomes more effective and visual.

With the professional advice we received, here is how we'll proceed:

### Partitioning the Tables

For table partitioning, we can use the following SQL commands:

**Partitioning the `user_data` table:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE user_data PARTITION BY HASH(user_id) PARTITIONS 16;
```
- This will create 16 partitions based on the hash value of the `user_id`, which should distribute the rows evenly among the partitions.

**Partitioning the `product_usage` table:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE product_usage PARTITION BY RANGE (YEAR(usage_date)*100 + MONTH(usage_date)) (
    PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN (202001),
    PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (202002),
    PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN (202003),
    ... -- continue for the required range
);
```
- This partitions the `product_usage` based on the `usage_date` month by month, which helps with time-based queries.

Before executing these scripts, we should analyze the current partitioning (if any), distribution of data, and future growth expectations to ensure that the partitioning strategy aligns with our data models.

### Setting Up Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana

To implement monitoring, we'll go through the following steps:

1. **Install `mysqld_exporter`** from its GitHub repository following the provided instructions.
2. **Configure `mysqld_exporter`** to expose MySQL server metrics by setting up the MySQL server's connection details.
3. **Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from `mysqld_exporter`** by adding a new scrape job in Prometheus's configuration file.
4. **Set scraping intervals** in Prometheus to define how often it should collect metrics from MySQL.
5. **Configure alert rules in Prometheus** to generate alerts based on specific system conditions.
6. **Integrate with Grafana** by adding Prometheus as the data source and creating dashboards that display the desired metrics visually.

Once we have this setup configured, we can ensure realtime tracking and alerting on database performance metrics.

Should we proceed with scripting these changes and implementing them in the database environment?
