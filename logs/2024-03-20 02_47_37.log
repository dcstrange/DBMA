🐧 Performance Agent 🗣️(responses to)  @os_expert_team_leader
Tuning MySQL to leverage the capabilities of NVM (non-volatile memory) storage and NovaFS (a file system designed for non-volatile main memory) involves several steps and best practices that can significantly accelerate performance. Here's a step-by-step guide:

### Understanding the Environment

1. **Hardware Specifications:**
   - Ensure you have NVM storage available and it's functioning properly.
   - Verify the available memory, CPU specifications, and network throughput.

2. **Software Prerequisites:**
   - Have MySQL installed and running.
   - Ensure NovaFS is set up on your system and properly mounted.

### MySQL Configuration Tuning

3. **Data Directory:**
   - Move the MySQL data directory to NVM storage for faster data access.
   - Update the `datadir` configuration in MySQL's my.cnf file to the new location on NovaFS.

4. **Table and Index Structures:**
   - Use InnoDB engine for tables as it provides better performance on NVM.
   - Optimize primary key usage for faster lookups.

5. **InnoDB Settings:**
   - `innodb_buffer_pool_size`: Set to 70%-80% of available memory as NVM provides ample high-speed storage.
   - `innodb_flush_method`: Set to `O_DIRECT` to avoid double buffering and leverage NVM's low latency.
   - `innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit`: Set to 1 for ACID compliance or 2 for performance if the slight risk of data loss is acceptable.
   - `innodb_log_file_size`: Increase size to reduce checkpointing frequency.
   - `innodb_io_capacity` and `innodb_io_capacity_max`: Adjust according to the throughput of the NVM.

6. **File System Specific:**
   - Use NovaFS-specific mount options to optimize for MySQL, such as disabling access time updates with 'noatime'.

### Best Practices

7. **Memory Allocation:**
   - Reserve enough memory for the operating system and other processes to avoid swapping.

8. **Concurrency Control:**
   - `innodb_thread_concurrency`: Set to an optimal value that matches CPU core count and workload characteristics.
   - `innodb_read_io_threads` and `innodb_write_io_threads`: Increase to improve parallel I/O operations.

9. **Write-Ahead Logging:**
   - Fine-tune the log buffer size to ensure efficient use of NVM's write capabilities.

10. **Monitoring and Benchmarking:**
    - Use monitoring tools to measure performance under different workloads.
    - Run regular benchmarks after each tuning step to assess impact.

11. **Regular Maintenance:**
    - Use MySQL's built-in optimization and analysis tools to maintain index and table health.
    - Defragment tables periodically if needed.

12. **Backup and Restore:**
    - Ensure there's a proper backup and restore strategy that takes into account the speed and nuances of restoring from NVM storage.

### Final Considerations

- Always test changes in a controlled environment before applying them to production.
- Update the configurations gradually and monitor for performance improvements or potential issues.
- Document all changes for future reference and troubleshooting.
- Stay updated with both MySQL and NovaFS releases, as performance optimizations are frequently included in new versions.

To implement these steps, coordinate with both database administrators and system engineers as they often require changes at both the database and system levels.

Optimizing a NovaFS file system on NVM storage hardware for compatibility and performance with MySQL involves several best practices that ensure the efficient utilization of the high-speed characteristics of non-volatile memory. Here are the key practices you should follow:

### Pre-Installation and Configuration

1. **Hardware Compatibility:**
   - Verify that your NVM storage device is supported and properly recognized by the Linux kernel.
   - Ensure you have the latest firmware for your NVM hardware for optimal performance.

2. **Kernel Support:**
   - Use a Linux kernel version that supports NovaFS. Check the project's documentation for compatibility details.
   - If necessary, compile a custom kernel with NovaFS support enabled.

### File System Creation and Mounting

3. **Creating NovaFS:**
   - Use the NovaFS utilities to format the NVM storage with NovaFS. Ensure to create separate partitions as needed for MySQL data and log files.

4. **Mounting Options:**
   - Mount the NovaFS with performance-optimized mount options, such as:
     - `noatime`: Prevents the updating of access times on files when they're read, reducing write operations.
     - `async`: Allows asynchronous writes, leveraging NVM's low latency.
     - Other options may be available depending on NovaFS's development; consult the latest documentation.

5. **File System Configuration:**
   - Adjust the NovaFS configuration to optimize for small and large files, as MySQL will store various sized files, from configuration to large data files and binary logs.

### MySQL-specific Optimizations

6. **Directory Layout:**
   - Organize directories to separate data files, log files, and temporary files, which may have different IO characteristics.

7. **Allocating Space:**
   - Pre-allocate space for database files to avoid fragmentation. This is less of an issue on NVM, but a consistent file structure can help maintain performance.

8. **InnoDB Configuration:**
   - Align MySQL's InnoDB settings with the performance characteristics of NovaFS and NVM. For example, the `innodb_flush_method` can be set to `O_DIRECT_NO_FSYNC` if NovaFS guarantees the persistence of writes.

### Maintenance and Monitoring

9. **Monitoring:**
   - Regularly monitor the file system and database performance. Tools such as iostat, vmstat, and MySQL's performance schema can be useful.

10. **Updates:**
    - Keep both NovaFS and MySQL updated to their latest stable versions to benefit from performance improvements and bug fixes.

11. **Testing:**
    - Run performance benchmarks after setting everything up to ensure that the system performs as expected under the workloads anticipated for your MySQL database.

### Data Integrity and Backup

12. **Journaling and Snapshots:**
    - If supported, configure journaling and snapshots to protect data integrity without compromising performance.

13. **Redundancy:**
    - Even with NVM, consider data redundancy mechanisms such as RAID if hardware failure is a concern for your use case.

14. **Backup Strategy:**
    - Plan and implement a backup strategy for your MySQL databases that utilize the fast read and write capabilities of NVM.

Remember that filesystem and storage optimizations may vary based on the specific workload and usage patterns of your MySQL database. It's critical to understand the nature of your MySQL workload to make appropriate optimizations. And as with any significant configuration change, it's best to test in a safe environment before deploying to production.

Optimizing the operating system to work with MySQL on NVM storage using NovaFS requires adjustments both at the system level and within the MySQL configuration. The ultimate goal is to ensure that the OS settings support the rapid IO capabilities of NVM, and that MySQL is tuned to take advantage of these enhancements. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to do this:

### System Optimization for NVM and NovaFS

1. **Kernel Parameters:**
   - Tune kernel parameters related to NVM and filesystems using the `sysctl` command. This may include adjusting the I/O scheduler, dirty writeback thresholds, and memory management options to minimize latency and maximize throughput.

2. **NUMA Configuration:**
   - For multi-socket systems with Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA), configure NUMA settings to ensure MySQL is using local memory close to the CPU where it's running, reducing memory access latency.

3. **Disable Unnecessary Services:**
   - Turn off services and daemons that are not necessary for the database operation to free up system resources.

4. **I/O Scheduler:**
   - Choose an I/O scheduler that is optimized for high-speed NVMe drives, such as `none` (to let NVMe drives handle the optimization) or `mq-deadline`.

5. **RAM Usage:**
   - Ensure sufficient RAM is available for MySQL's buffer pool to reduce I/O operations even further, even though NVM is fast, RAM is still quicker for caching purposes.

6. **CPU Governor:**
   - Set the CPU governor to `performance` to prevent the CPU from downscaling its frequency in low-load conditions.

### MySQL Configuration Optimization for NVM with NovaFS

7. **File System Options:**
   - Use MySQL's `innodb_flush_method` set to `O_DIRECT_NO_FSYNC` with NovaFS to avoid unnecessary overhead.

8. **InnoDB Buffer Pool:**
   - Allocate enough memory to the `innodb_buffer_pool_size` to reduce read I/O, but do not starve the system from memory or ignore the speed benefits of NVM.

9. **Log Files:**
   - Increase the size of the InnoDB log files (`innodb_log_file_size`) to allow larger transactions to run without the need for frequent log flushes.

10. **Binary Log:**
    - Consider disabling binary logs if not needed for replication or backup purposes; if needed, place them on the NVM under NovaFS for increased performance.

11. **Temp Tables:**
    - Configure MySQL to use RAM-based temporary tables when possible by adjusting `tmp_table_size` and `max_heap_table_size`.

12. **Thread Handling:**
    - Optimize thread handling (`innodb_thread_concurrency`, `thread_cache_size`, `innodb_read_io_threads`, `innodb_write_io_threads`) based on the hardware's capabilities and MySQL's workload.

### Monitoring and Maintenance

13. **Continuous Monitoring:**
    - Use tools like `vmstat`, `iostat`, `htop`, `perf`, and MySQL's `SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS` for monitoring your system's performance and identifying issues.

14. **System Updates:**
    - Keep your system up to date with the latest kernels, NovaFS updates, and NVM firmware updates to benefit from the latest performance optimizations and bug fixes.

15. **Regular Performance Tuning:**
    - Regularly review and tune the settings as the database workload evolves and as updates are made to the hardware or software environment.

### Testing and Evaluation

16. **Baseline Performance:**
    - Before optimization, establish a performance baseline to measure the improvement.

17. **Benchmarking:**
    - Use MySQL benchmarking tools to test the effects of configuration changes.

Implementing all of these steps should yield substantial performance improvements. However, because system configurations can be complex, it's often a good idea to make changes incrementally, test them thoroughly, and monitor closely for any unintended side effects. Additionally, always ensure that you have proper backup systems and rollback plans in place before making any changes to production systems.

The steps suggested by our experts to optimize the MySQL ACID configuration in preparation for the migration to the new NVM storage with NovaFS include system-level optimizations as well as MySQL-specific configurations. Here's a summary of the recommendations across the board:

### Understanding the Environment
- Confirm hardware and software compatibility, including the correct installation of MySQL and NovaFS.

### MySQL Configuration Tuning
- Move the MySQL data directory to NVM storage.
- Use InnoDB engine and tune related settings like `innodb_buffer_pool_size`, `innodb_flush_method`, and `innodb_io_capacity`.
- Optimize write-ahead logging and configure memory settings to prevent swapping.

### File System and OS Optimizations
- Kernel parameter adjustments and I/O scheduler selection to enhance performance.
- NUMA settings, disabling unnecessary services, and ensuring sufficient CPU and RAM resources are allocated.

### Migration Best Practices
- Check hardware compatibility and update firmware.
- Optimize file system configurations, create NovaFS with appropriate partitions, and pre-allocate space to minimize fragmentation.
- Implement continuous monitoring and have a backup protocol in place.
- Benchmark the performance under typical workloads.

### Post-Optimization
- Monitor improvements and issues after each configuration change.
- Establish performance baselines and perform regular benchmarking to evaluate adjustments.

These insights highlight the importance of integrating both MySQL-specific and system-level adjustments for optimal performance. It's crucial to apply these changes first in a non-production environment, and to continuously monitor the outcomes post-implementation. Keeping all systems up to date and documenting configurations is also highlighted.

As for the user's tip regarding involving a team of OS experts, the performance tuning expert has provided OS-level optimization advice such as kernel parameter adjustments and I/O scheduler settings, as well as MySQL configuration advice, which should already encompass that knowledge.

The next step would be to commence with the migration of the MySQL database to the new NVM storage while ensuring all optimizations are considered to fully capitalize on the performance capabilities of the NVM with NovaFS. It's important to proceed with caution, with proper backups and rollback plans in place, conducting thorough testing, and making incremental changes.

Let's proceed with the task at hand and keep stakeholders posted on the progress.
