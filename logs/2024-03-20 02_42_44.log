When optimizing MySQL ACID configurations for non-volatile memory (NVM) storage hardware, such as NVMe SSDs, the goal is to take advantage of the high throughput and low latency characteristics of these devices. Here are some best practices:

1. **Enable innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit**:
   - For NVM storage, setting `innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit=1` provides ACID compliance by ensuring the log is flushed to disk at the end of each transaction. Despite NVM's fast performance, this might not be needed because some NVMs have power-loss protection which can act as a persistent memory.

2. **Configure innodb_io_capacity and innodb_io_capacity_max**:
   - Adjust these parameters to match the IOPS capabilities of your NVM hardware. These settings control the background I/O rate for InnoDB.

3. **Utilize innodb_flush_neighbors**:
   - Typically, this is set to `1` for spinning disks, but for NVM storage, it's often beneficial to set it to `0` since NVMs can handle random I/O almost as efficiently as sequential I/O.

4. **Reduce innodb_log_file_size**:
   - If using NVMs, you might benefit from smaller log files because the log can be written and synced faster, thus reducing the commit latency.

5. **Optimize innodb_buffer_pool_size**:
   - Although NVMs can handle more IOPS, having a buffer pool that is large enough to hold your hot data is still important. Configure it to make the best use of your available RAM.

6. **Adjust innodb_write_io_threads and innodb_read_io_threads**:
   - These parameters define the number of threads that can write to and read from the disk. With NVM storage, you can increase these values to better leverage the concurrent I/O capabilities.

7. **Fine-tune innodb_thread_concurrency**:
   - This setting determines the maximum number of concurrently active threads in InnoDB. Since NVM can handle high concurrency, you might increase this value.

8. **Experiment with innodb_flush_method**:
   - The `O_DIRECT` setting is usually recommended for flash storage to bypass the file-system cache. For NVM, testing with and without `O_DIRECT` is recommended to determine the best performance.

9. **Utilize innodb_adaptive_hash_index**:
   - This index can speed up searches for InnoDB tables if a good portion of the buffer pool is dedicated to it. Monitor the performance to see if this feature is beneficial with your NVM setup.

10. **Monitor ACID compliance**:
    - Regardless of performance optimizations, ensure that your configuration maintains ACID compliance. This might involve a balance between performance and durability guarantees.

11. **Hardware considerations**:
    - Ensure firmware and drivers are up to date.
    - Use file systems that are optimized for NVM storage, such as ext4 or xfs with appropriate mount options.

12. **Backup considerations**:
    - Even though NVM is reliable, have a solid backup and recovery strategy in place considering the specifics of your storage.

Remember to conduct performance testing after each change to validate the benefits of the configuration adjustments. Since direct interaction with the operating system might improve MySQL performance on NVMs, particularly regarding file system choices and block device configurations, it may be beneficial to consult with an OS expert.

Finally, always keep in mind that tuning recommendations can vary depending on the specific workload and hardware configuration. As such, it's important to monitor your system and make adjustments as needed.

Migrating an existing MySQL database to new NVM (Non-Volatile Memory) storage hardware while ensuring minimal downtime and data integrity involves several strategic steps. Here are some recommended strategies to consider:

1. **Pre-Migration Planning**
   - **Assessment and Inventory**: Document the current database environment, including database size, performance metrics, and version.
   - **Testing NVM Hardware**: Ensure the new storage is functioning correctly and is properly configured for high performance with MySQL.
   - **Compatibility Checks**: Verify that the current version of MySQL is compatible with the NVM hardware.

2. **Backup and Recovery**
   - **Comprehensive Backup**: Execute a full backup of the database to ensure that you have a recoverable copy in case something goes wrong during the migration.
   - **Recovery Plan**: Establish a recovery plan with clearly defined RPO (Recovery Point Objective) and RTO (Recovery Time Objective).

3. **Migration Method**
   - **Physical Migration**: Use a physical file copy method, like `rsync` or MySQL Enterprise Backup, to clone the database files directly to the new storage.
   - **Logical Migration**: Use a logical backup and restore approach with tools such as `mysqldump` or `mydumper`/`myloader` for exporting and importing the database schema and data.

4. **Downtime Minimization**
   - **Replication**: Configure replication from the old to the new server. Once the data is synced, you can cut over to the NVM hardware with minimal downtime.
   - **Delayed Replication**: Delay the replication to give yourself a window to test on the new storage before the final switchover.

5. **Data Sync and Validation**
   - **Data Comparison**: Before the final cut-over, ensure that data is consistent between the old and the new storage using checksums or other data comparison tools.
   - **Synchronization Tools**: Use tools like Percona Toolkit's `pt-table-sync` to resolve any discrepancies if using replication.

6. **Monitor and Optimize**
   - **Performance Monitoring**: Set up monitoring on the new hardware with tools like Prometheus and Grafana to compare performance against the old setup.
   - **Optimization**: Adjust MySQL configuration settings to optimize the database for the better I/O capabilities of NVM.

7. **Execution**
   - **Maintenance Window**: Choose a low-traffic window to reduce the impact of the short downtime required for the final cut-over.
   - **Switching Traffic**: Redirect database traffic from the old storage to the new NVM storage. 

8. **Post-Migration**
   - **Validation**: Run integrity and performance tests to ensure that the database is operating as expected on the new hardware.
   - **Fallback Plan**: Have a clear rollback plan if serious issues are encountered after the migration.
   - **Decommission**: Once satisfied with the migration, securely decommission the old storage equipment.

9. **Documentation and Training**
   - **Update Documentation**: Document the new configuration and any changed procedures.
   - **Team Training**: Inform and train the relevant team members on the new hardware and any changes to the operating procedures.

By carefully planning and sequencing the migration activities, you can achieve a smooth transition to the new NVM storage hardware with minimal downtime and ensure full data integrity. It's essential to have monitoring in place to detect and resolve any issues quickly, as well as maintain comprehensive documentation of the new system configuration for ongoing operations and maintenance.

Optimizing MySQL database performance on Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) storage involves considering both general MySQL performance tuning and specific adjustments to take advantage of the high-speed characteristics of NVM storage. NVM, such as NVMe SSDs, offer significantly faster read/write speeds and lower latency compared to traditional HDDs or even SATA SSDs.

Here's how various OS-level configurations can impact MySQL performance:

### 1. File System Choice
- **Impact**: Different file systems can handle parallel I/O operations more efficiently, which is key for high-speed storage devices.
- **Optimization**: Use a file system known for good performance with SSDs, like `ext4`, `XFS`, or `Btrfs`. Ensure it's properly aligned with the storage's erase block size to avoid performance penalties.

### 2. I/O Scheduler
- **Impact**: The I/O scheduler determines how read and write operations are prioritized and can greatly affect database performance.
- **Optimization**: For NVM devices, the `none` or `noop` scheduler may be best as they do the least amount of I/O reordering, letting the device's own controller manage the queue.

### 3. Swappiness
- **Impact**: The swappiness value controls the tendency of the kernel to move processes out of physical memory and onto the swap space, which can slow down database operations if it happens frequently.
- **Optimization**: Set swappiness to a low value (e.g., `1`) for databases to keep processes in memory as much as possible.

### 4. Dirty Ratio Settings
- **Impact**: These settings determine when the kernel flushes modified ("dirty") data to disk. Inadequate values can either lead to data loss on a crash or cause unnecessary I/O wait.
- **Optimization**: Fine-tune `dirty_background_ratio` and `dirty_ratio` parameters to balance between data safety and system responsiveness.

### 5. Transparent Huge Pages
- **Impact**: Huge pages can reduce CPU usage by reducing page faults but might introduce additional latency in certain workloads.
- **Optimization**: Monitor performance with and without transparent huge pages enabled and choose based on which setting offers better performance for your specific workload.

### 6. Network Configuration
- **Impact**: Network settings can affect the performance of remote database connections.
- **Optimization**: Optimize TCP/IP settings, increase buffers, and keep `time_wait` intervals low to handle high-speed networking.

### 7. NUMA Architecture
- **Impact**: Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) can impact performance if the database system spans multiple NUMA nodes.
- **Optimization**: Configure MySQL and the OS to recognize NUMA boundaries, or use `numactl` to run database processes with memory allocated from a local node.

### Best Practices for MySQL on NVM
- Use a recent version of MySQL that includes optimizations for SSDs.
- Align partitions to the storage device's erase block size.
- Enable the `innodb_flush_neighbors` setting to `0` for SSDs to avoid unnecessary I/O.
- Adjust the InnoDB buffer pool size depending on the system's available memory.
- Monitor I/O patterns and tune `innodb_io_capacity` and `innodb_io_capacity_max` accordingly.
- Regularly perform maintenance such as table optimization and defragmentation, as this can matter even on fast storage.

For specific recommandations and verifications on the configurations, it's recommended to use monitoring tools like `iostat`, `vmstat`, `numastat`, `sar`, and MySQL's performance schema to collect metrics before and after making changes. Depending on your exact setup and requirements, different optimizations may yield better results. Always test configurations in a controlled environment before applying them to production systems.
