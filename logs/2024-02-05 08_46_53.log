👤 User: Requires you to perform a system overhaul for EduDataDB on the university server DB_Server_Edu. This includes migrating the student_records and course_catalog databases to a new server, DB_Server_EduNew, and updating the data model to better meet the evolving educational structure. Following the migration, you will also be required to conduct a full security audit to ensure that student data is protected in accordance with new privacy laws.

### Step 1. **Initial Request Analysis**:

- **Objective**: Analyze and extract relevant types of the user's request.

- **Method**:
    - Analyze and extract relevant types of the user's request. Use the predefined types as reference.

- **Output**:

    - Type of request: Performing O&M actions
    - Reasoning: The user has requested the execution of specific operational and maintenance tasks, which include migrating databases to a new server and conducting a full security audit. 

### Step 2. **O&M Topic Extraction**:

- **Objective**: Identify and extract relevant O&M topics from the user request for the identified type of request.

- **Method**:
    - Review the user's request for keywords or phrases that align with predefined O&M topics.

- **Output**:
    - Relevant O&M Topics:
        - Database Migration: The request involves migrating the "student_records" and "course_catalog" databases to a new server, DB_Server_EduNew.
        - Data Modeling and Design: The user has indicated a need to update the data model to better serve the educational structure.
        - Security Auditing: Following the migration, a full security audit is required to protect student data in compliance with new privacy laws.

### Step 3. **Generate User's Request Analysis YAML Results**:

```
Request Analysis:
- Type: Performing O&M actions
    Rationale: The user has explicitly requested the execution of operational and maintenance tasks, including database migration, data model updates, and a security audit.
    Topics:
    - Topic: Database Migration

    - Topic: Data Modeling and Design
        Explanation: The user wants to update the data model to adapt to changes in the educational structure.
    - Topic: Security Auditing
        Explanation: A security audit is to be conducted post-migration to ensure compliance with new privacy laws.
```

### Step 4. **User Interaction**:

---
Request Analysis:
- Type: Performing O&M actions
