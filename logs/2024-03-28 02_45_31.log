To optimize the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties of a MySQL database instance, "DB_1," and take advantage of a Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) storage environment using NovaFS, we need to consider the strengths of NVM, such as lower latency, higher throughput, and byte-addressability.

Here are detailed settings and optimization recommendations for "DB_1":

1. **Atomicity**:
   - Utilize atomic write capabilities of NVM to ensure that transactions are either fully completed or not at all, contributing to reduced overhead in undo logging.
   - Use the `innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit` setting to ensure transaction log flushes align with NVM's characteristics. Depending on the criticality of the data, you might choose to relax the flushing frequency.

2. **Consistency**:
   - Ensure `innodb_strict_mode` is enabled to enforce strict SQL mode, which helps in maintaining data consistency.
   - Verify the `innodb_file_per_table` is ON so that each InnoDB table is stored in a separate tablespace file, allowing for better consistency checks and recovery.

3. **Isolation**:
   - Choose the appropriate transaction isolation level. Given the higher throughput of NVM, you can often afford to use repeatable read or even serializable without incurring the same performance penalties as you might with traditional storage.
   - Keep the `innodb_lock_wait_timeout` setting at an optimal value to prevent long wait times for row locks, which should be lesser concerns with faster NVM access.

4. **Durability**:
   - Set `innodb_doublewrite` to OFF. NVM's reduced risk of torn writes allows for disabling of the doublewrite buffer, which traditionally helps safeguard against partial page writes on disk.
   - Configure `innodb_flush_method` to `O_DIRECT_NO_FSYNC`, which aligns with NVM's ability to withstand power outages and ensure data durability without needing frequent syncs.
   - With NovaFS/WAL integration, leverage its low-latency log-structured design for the transaction log to maximize durability, ensuring transactions are persisted effectively with the NVM's endurance characteristics.

5. **General NVM Optimizations**:
   - Since NVM is comparable to RAM speed, adjust `innodb_buffer_pool_size` cautiously. NVM's fast read and write capabilities might reduce the reliance on a large buffer pool.
   - As file system operations are significantly faster, settings like `innodb_io_capacity` and `innodb_io_capacity_max` can be increased to fully utilize the IO throughput of NVM.
   - Use file formats and block sizes that align with the NVM characteristics to minimize the performance overhead associated with IO and page management.

6. **Logging and Checkpointing**:
   - Optimize redo logging and checkpointing to make effective use of NVM's fast write ability. You might reduce the frequency and size of checkpoints as NVM can handle more writes in a given time.
   - Investigate if the use of binary logs can be optimized, given that recovery from crashes would be faster on NVM.

7. **Backup and Recovery**:
   - Configure more frequent backups given the read/write speed of NVM without unduly impacting performance.

Keep in mind that these recommendations should be tested and validated in a controlled environment before being applied to the production system. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of these settings are necessary to align them with the actual workload patterns and to fully harness the benefits of NVM storage using NovaFS.
