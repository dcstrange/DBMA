ü¶ä expert_scaling üó£Ô∏è(responses to)  @expert_perf_tuning
To optimize MySQL's ACID configuration for new NVM (Non-Volatile Memory) storage using NovaFS (which is optimized for NVM), you will need to tailor several InnoDB parameters for the performance characteristics of NVM. Here‚Äôs a guide on best practices for scaling and adjusting MySQL for NVM storage:

**1. Optimize InnoDB Flush Method:**

   For NVM storage, `innodb_flush_method` should generally be set to `O_DIRECT` or `O_DIRECT_NO_FSYNC`, as these methods bypass the OS buffer cache and reduce I/O overhead. `O_DIRECT_NO_FSYNC` can be particularly beneficial for NVM, as it won't call `fsync()` after each write operation, which is less crucial with NVM's persistence capabilities.
   
**2. Configure InnoDB IO Capacity:**

   Because NVM has higher throughput and lower latency than traditional SSDs or HDDs, you can increase the `innodb_io_capacity` and `innodb_io_capacity_max` to values that correspond to your NVM's abilities. These settings control the background I/O rate for flushing dirty pages and merging the change buffer.

**3. Adjust InnoDB Log File Size:**

   The `innodb_log_file_size` setting determines the size of the redo logs, which is crucial for recovery performance. Bigger log files can reduce the checkpointing frequency but might lead to longer recovery times. With NVM's high-speed data transfer rates, you can afford larger log files for better performance without significantly impacting recovery time.

**4. Fine-Tune Durability Settings:**

   With NVM's inherent durability, consider adjusting the `innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit` parameter. Setting it to '2' might be a suitable compromise between durability and performance, as it only flushes the log buffer to storage once per second but still writes after each transaction.

**5. Reevaluate Doublewrite Buffer Needs:**

   The InnoDB doublewrite buffer prevents data corruption on page writes, but it comes with a performance cost. Given that NVM devices have built-in mechanisms to prevent torn writes, you could potentially disable the doublewrite buffer using `innodb_doublewrite = 0`.

**6. Enable Compression:**

   NovaFS supports transparent compression which can be advantageous since it allows higher effective storage capacity and potentially reduces I/O overhead. You can enable InnoDB table compression if it suits your workload.

**7. Monitor and Tune FS Block Size:**

   Keep the file system block size in consideration, and make sure it's aligned with the InnoDB page size for optimal I/O patterns. NovaFS might favor certain block sizes depending on its implementation and your storage's characteristics.

**8. Update Buffer Pool Size:**

   The buffer pool size (`innodb_buffer_pool_size`) should be large enough to accommodate your working set. With NVM, depending on your system's RAM, you might not need as large a buffer pool.

**9. Leverage High Concurrency:**

   NVM has excellent concurrency properties. Make use of parallel threads for flushing (`innodb_write_io_threads`, `innodb_read_io_threads`) and ensure that thread concurrency settings (`innodb_thread_concurrency`) are high enough to exploit the NVM's IOPS capabilities.

**10. Regular Monitoring and Benchmarking:**

   Continuously monitor the performance and adjust the above parameters as needed. Use MySQL's performance schema and tools like Prometheus and Grafana to get insights into your configuration's effectiveness.

Before making any production changes, it's crucial to test these configurations in a staging environment that reflects your actual workload. Benchmarking with tools like sysbench can help you understand the impact of these changes and fine-tune further. Always back up data and have a recovery plan in place before making significant changes.

Remember, every environment is unique, and configurations that work for one setup might not work for another. Implement changes incrementally and monitor their impact closely.

To configure Prometheus to collect performance metrics for a MySQL database, you'll need to follow the steps to set up the necessary exporters and configure Prometheus to scrape these metrics. Please note that while Prometheus can natively scrape metrics from various exporters, some system-level metrics, like I/O wait time, throughput, latency, and IOPS, may require the Node Exporter or other system-level exporters for full visibility. Regarding MySQL-specific metrics and CPU/RAM usage, we'll use the mysqld_exporter and node_exporter. Here's a step-by-step guide to setting up the monitoring for each requirement:

### 1. Install Node Exporter
Node Exporter is used to collect system-level metrics like CPU, RAM, and disk I/O performance, which would include your NovaFS metrics.

#### Step 1: Download and Install Node Exporter
You can download the latest version of Node Exporter from the official Prometheus website or GitHub repository.

#### Step 2: Start Node Exporter
Run the Node Exporter binary, typically with a command like `./node_exporter`.

#### Step 3: Configure Prometheus to Scrape Node Exporter
Add a scrape configuration to your Prometheus configuration file (`prometheus.yml`) for the Node Exporter:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'node'
    static_configs:
    - targets: ['localhost:9100']
```

Replace `localhost` with the IP address of the machine if Prometheus is running on a different server.

### 2. Install mysqld_exporter
mysqld_exporter is used for MySQL-specific metrics such as database query performance.

#### Step 1: Download and Install mysqld_exporter
Similar to Node Exporter, find the latest release on the official Prometheus or GitHub page.

#### Step 2: Configure MySQL for mysqld_exporter
You will need to create a dedicated MySQL user with the proper permissions that the exporter can use to fetch the metrics.

```sql
CREATE USER 'exporter'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YourPassword' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 3;
GRANT PROCESS, REPLICATION CLIENT, SELECT ON *.* TO 'exporter'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

#### Step 3: Provide mysqld_exporter with MySQL Credentials
You will need to provide the credentials to the mysqld_exporter, typically by using a `.my.cnf` file with the user's details:

```ini
[client]
user=exporter
password=YourPassword
```

#### Step 4: Start mysqld_exporter
Use the configuration file when starting the mysqld_exporter.

#### Step 5: Configure Prometheus to Scrape mysqld_exporter
Add another job in your `prometheus.yml` for the MySQL exporter:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'mysql'
    static_configs:
    - targets: ['localhost:9104']
```

### Tracking I/O Performance for NovaFS
For I/O wait time (1), Read/Write throughput (2), Latency (3), and IOPS (4), Node Exporter collects various metrics that can be used to assess the performance of the file system, including NovaFS.

For specific NovaFS monitoring, you would have to ensure that Node Exporter is exposing the relevant metrics for your new NVM storage. If NovaFS provides its metrics or has a way of exposing them, you may need to write custom collectors or use additional exporters.

If there are no existing exporters available for NovaFS, you might have to create a custom exporter that uses NovaFS's monitoring APIs or command-line tools to collect the necessary metrics and presents them in a format that Prometheus can scrape.

###  Monitoring CPU and RAM Usage (6)
Node Exporter, as mentioned above, will also provide metrics for CPU and RAM usage, which can be scraped and visualized using Prometheus and associated tools like Grafana.

### Summarizing these steps:
1. Install Node Exporter to collect system-level metrics.
2. Install mysqld_exporter to collect MySQL-specific metrics.
3. Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from these exporters.
4. For NovaFS, identify how it exposes metrics. If needed, implement a custom solution.

To execute these steps, we will prepare command scripts to install Node Exporter and mysqld_exporter, along with the configurations for Prometheus, and create a user in MySQL for the mysqld_exporter. However, for creating custom exporters or handling specific NovaFS metrics, you may need in-depth custom development that is beyond the scope of a simple command script. If a custom exporter for NovaFS is required, this will involve programming and extensive understanding of both NovaFS and Prometheus exporter development.

The steps provided offer a comprehensive guide on setting up Prometheus to monitor the performance of a MySQL database using NVM storage with NovaFS. For the specific task of tracking I/O performance for NovaFS, you should ensure that the Node Exporter is configured to collect metrics relevant to the filesystem and storage, which may also involve creating a custom exporter if NovaFS has unique metrics that are not covered by standard exporters.

Here is a summary of the instructions given to the `db_env_proxy` for executing the configuration:

1. **Install Node Exporter** for system-level metrics, including CPU, RAM, and disk I/O performance.
   - Download and start the Node Exporter.
   - Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from Node Exporter.

2. **Install mysqld_exporter** for MySQL-specific metrics.
   - Download and set up mysqld_exporter with MySQL user credentials.
   - Start mysqld_exporter with the correct MySQL user permissions.
   - Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from mysqld_exporter.

3. Determine if NovaFS provides custom metrics and whether a custom exporter is needed to track specific I/O performance metrics for the filesystem. If a custom solution is necessary, consider developing an exporter that can interface with NovaFS monitoring tools or APIs and supply Prometheus with the needed metrics.

Following the outlined steps will allow you to configure Prometheus to collect and monitor the desired performance metrics for your MySQL database on new NVM storage with NovaFS.

To successfully adopt new NVM storage hardware using NovaFS with MySQL database systems and see performance improvements, you will need to make some specific configurations around MySQL‚Äôs ACID properties, particularly within the InnoDB storage engine, and adjust your monitoring setup to track performance accurately. Below are the detailed guidelines and instructions for both optimizing configurations and monitoring.

### Adjusting MySQL ACID Configuration for NVM with NovaFS:

1. **Optimize InnoDB Flush Method**: Set `innodb_flush_method` to `O_DIRECT` or `O_DIRECT_NO_FSYNC` to avoid unnecessary OS buffer cache usage and reduce I/O overhead. The latter option can be especially advantageous for NVM, since the persistence of NVM reduces the need for frequent fsync calls.

2. **Configure InnoDB IO Capacity**: Adjust `innodb_io_capacity` and `innodb_io_capacity_max` to align with your NVM's high throughput and low latency characteristics.

3. **Adjust InnoDB Log File Size**: Consider increasing `innodb_log_file_size` due to the fast data transfer rates of NVM, reducing checkpointing frequency without major impacts on recovery time.

4. **Fine-Tune Durability Settings**: Modify `innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit` settings, potentially setting it to `2` for a balance between durability and performance.

5. **Reevaluate Doublewrite Buffer Needs**: Disable InnoDB's doublewrite buffer with `innodb_doublewrite = 0` if your NVM hardware prevents torn writes.

6. **Enable Compression**: Utilize the transparent compression supported by NovaFS to reduce I/O overhead and increase storage capacity.

7. **Monitor and Tune FS Block Size**: Optimize the alignment between file system block size and InnoDB page size to ensure efficient I/O patterns.

8. **Update Buffer Pool Size**: Size `innodb_buffer_pool_size` according to your working set; NVM might allow for a reduced buffer pool size considering your system's RAM.

9. **Leverage High Concurrency**: Capitalize on NVM's concurrency features by using parallel threads for flushing (`innodb_write_io_threads`, `innodb_read_io_threads`) and appropriate `innodb_thread_concurrency` settings.

10. **Regular Monitoring and Benchmarking**: Continuously monitor performance and adjust parameters as required using tools like MySQL's Performance Schema, Prometheus, and Grafana.

Before any production changes, conduct thorough testing in a staging environment. Implement adjustments incrementally and monitor closely.

### Monitoring Configuration:

For monitoring the performance benefits, install Node Exporter to collect metrics like CPU, RAM, and disk I/O performance, and mysqld_exporter for MySQL-specific metrics.

Determine if you need a custom exporter for NovaFS-specific I/O performance metrics, which could include:

- **Custom Exporter for NovaFS Metrics (if required)**: Develop an exporter that communicates with NovaFS's own monitoring tools or APIs to provide metrics on specific I/O performance.

- **Configure Prometheus Scraping**: Adjust Prometheus to scrape metrics from the installed Node Exporter as well as mysqld_exporter or any custom NovaFS exporter.

Implementing these adjustments should allow you to track performance accurately and take full advantage of the speed and efficiency of NVM storage with NovaFS in your MySQL database environment.

When scaling a MySQL installation on NVM storage hardware with NovaFS, the scalability considerations you have to look into are not too different from traditional storage systems, yet they play a more enhanced role due to the performance characteristics of NVM. Here's some guidance on adjustments and insights specific to scalability:

**1. InnoDB Buffer Pool Instances:**

   Increase the `innodb_buffer_pool_instances` to spread data and I/O activity across multiple buffer pool instances. This can decrease contention and improve the concurrency on multi-core systems which is important to take advantage of the low latency of NVM.

**2. Adjust Thread Concurrency:**

   With the low latency and high throughput of NVM, the `innodb_thread_concurrency` may need to be higher compared to HDD/SSD setups. This allows MySQL to open more parallel threads and make full use of NVM speeds without being bottlenecked.

**3. Adaptive Hash Index:**

   The `innodb_adaptive_hash_index` allows InnoDB to build in-memory hash indexes for faster lookups, and it can be particularly effective with NVM. However, monitor the effectiveness and only enable it if it adds real performance benefits as it can add overhead in some cases.

**4. Tune I/O Capacity Settings:**

   While `innodb_io_capacity` was mentioned for performance purposes, it is equally important for scalability. By accurately configuring this setting along with `innodb_io_capacity_max`, you allow InnoDB to scale its I/O operations dynamically in response to the workload without creating I/O bottlenecks.

**5. Evaluate Durable Settings:**

   Durability ensures that even in the event of a crash, you don't lose transactions that the database acknowledged. NVM storage can persist writes more quickly, so you may choose a different trade-off between ACID compliance and performance than with slower storage.

**6. Max Connections:**

   Increase the `max_connections` to allow more simultaneous client connections. Ensure this is tuned to align with the OS‚Äôs capabilities to handle a large number of open files and threads, taking into consideration NVM's capability to handle higher I/O workloads.

**7. Sharding for Horizontal Scalability:**

   If you anticipate growing beyond what a single MySQL server can handle, plan for sharding. It allows you to distribute data across different machines while leveraging NVM's performance to scale out your database horizontally.

**8. Replication and Read Scaling:**

   Use MySQL replication to scale out read operations. With the high-throughput capabilities of NVM, replicas can catch up faster and stay more closely in sync with the master, enhancing read scalability.

**9. Use of MySQL Cluster (NDB):**

   For applications requiring extremely high write and read scalability along with fault tolerance, you might consider MySQL Cluster (NDB). NVM storage could further enhance its already high base performance.

**10. Regular Monitoring and Capacity Planning:**

   Implement robust monitoring with performance metrics specific to NVM. Capacity planning becomes easier and potentially more efficient because of NVM's performance, but it's still critical to understand your application's growth patterns and plan accordingly.

**11. Review Consistency Model:**

   NovaFS' consistency guarantees will affect how you set up MySQL's ACID properties. Ensure that the file system does not compromise the database's consistency in any way.

Lastly, any changes to MySQL settings and server parameters should be rolled out cautiously and backed with meticulous testing. Scalability not only depends on how well the database performs under load but also on how it recovers from failure states and maintains data integrity. Keep scaling practices like replication, sharding, and clustering in mind to ensure that sustained growth doesn't lead to bottlenecks or performance degradation.

10. **Monitoring and Capacity Planning**: Practice robust monitoring and capacity planning to prepare for growth.
11. **Consistency Model**: Ensure that NovaFS's consistency model aligns with MySQL's ACID properties.

For all the recommended adjustments, the following needs to be ensured:
- **Testing**: Thoroughly test all changes in a staging environment before making any production changes.
- **Incremental Change**: Implement adjustments gradually and observe their impact closely.
- **Documentation**: Document all changes, benchmarks, and observed effects for reference and future adjustments.

As the O&M Team Leader, ensure these comprehensive strategies are appropriately communicated, tasks are assigned to corresponding team members, and the changes are effectively coordinated to achieve the desired performance improvements with the new NVM hardware integration.
