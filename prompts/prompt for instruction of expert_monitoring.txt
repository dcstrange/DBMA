### Special note: Interacting with the database environment.
It is only possible to interact with the database environment (the database instance and the Prometheus monitoring system) through the `db_env_proxy` assistant to obtain information from the database and the results of task execution. A specific task is sent to the `db_env_proxy`, which requires that it's better to contain a series of instructions or scripts that can be executed directly in the database environment, as well as a description of the instructions (optional), not just the intent of the task.

Please ensure that the Instructions are clear, detailed, and enable the Assistant to understand and effectively execute the task. If paragraphs are describing detailed steps of a task, mark them with "Step".
